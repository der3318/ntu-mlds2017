CHAPTER I It all came to me one election day . 
Because of the warmth of the day I had had several drinks before casting my ballot , and divers drinks after casting it . 
Then I had ridden up through the vine clad hills and rolling pastures of the ranch , and arrived at the farm house in time for another drink and supper . 
How did you vote on the suffrage amendment ? Charmian asked . 
She uttered an exclamation of surprise . 
For , be it known , in my younger days , despite my ardent democracy , I had been opposed to woman suffrage . 
In my later and more tolerant years I had been unenthusiastic in my acceptance of it as an inevitable social phenomenon . 
Now just why did you vote for it ? Charmian asked . 
The more I answered , the more indignant I became . 
And yet how shall I say ? I was lighted up , I was feeling good , I was pleasantly jingled . 
When the women get the ballot , they will vote for prohibition , I said . 
I am never less his friend than when he is with me and when I seem most his friend . 
He is the king of liars . 
He is the frankest truthsayer . 
He is the august companion with whom one walks with the gods . 
He is also in league with the Noseless One . 
His way leads to truth naked , and to death . 
He gives clear vision , and muddy dreams . 
He is the enemy of life , and the teacher of wisdom beyond life's wisdom . 
He is a red handed killer , and he slays youth . 
And Charmian looked at me , and I knew she wondered where I had got it . 
As I say , I was lighted up . 
In my brain every thought was at home . 
Every thought , in its little cell , crouched ready dressed at the door , like prisoners at midnight a jail break . 
And every thought was a vision , bright imaged , sharp cut , unmistakable . 
My brain was illuminated by the clear , white light of alcohol . 
John Barleycorn was on a truth telling rampage , giving away the choicest secrets on himself . 
And I was his spokesman . 
There moved the multitudes of memories of my past life , all orderly arranged like soldiers in some vast review . 
It was mine to pick and choose . 
I was a lord of thought , the master of my vocabulary and of the totality of my experience , unerringly capable of selecting my data and building my exposition . 
For so John Barleycorn tricks and lures , setting the maggots of intelligence gnawing , whispering his fatal intuitions of truth , flinging purple passages into the monotony of one's days . 
I outlined my life to Charmian , and expounded the make up of my constitution . 
I was no hereditary alcoholic . 
I had been born with no organic , chemical predisposition toward alcohol . 
In this matter I was normal in my generation . 
Alcohol was an acquired taste . 
It had been painfully acquired . 
Alcohol had been a dreadfully repugnant thing more nauseous than any physic . 
Even now I did not like the taste of it . 
I drank it only for its kick . 
And from the age of five to that of twenty five I had not learned to care for its kick . 
Twenty years of unwilling apprenticeship had been required to make my system rebelliously tolerant of alcohol , to make me , in the heart and the deeps of me , desirous of alcohol . 
Not only had it always been accessible , but every interest of my developing life had drawn me to it . 
The saloon was the place of congregation . 
Men gathered to it as primitive men gathered about the fire of the squatting place or the fire at the mouth of the cave . 
As a youth , by way of the saloon I had escaped from the narrowness of woman's influence into the wide free world of men . 
All ways led to the saloon . 
The thousand roads of romance and adventure drew together in the saloon , and thence led out and on over the world . 
The point is , I concluded my sermon , that it is the accessibility of alcohol that has given me my taste for alcohol . 
I did not care for it . 
I used to laugh at it . 
Yet here I am , at the last , possessed with the drinker's desire . 
It took twenty years to implant that desire and for ten years more that desire has grown . 
And the effect of satisfying that desire is anything but good . 
Temperamentally I am wholesome hearted and merry . 
Yet when I walk with John Barleycorn I suffer all the damnation of intellectual pessimism . 
, John Barleycorn must have his due . 
He does tell the truth . 
That is the curse of it . 
The so called truths of life are not true . 
They are the vital lies by which life lives , and John Barleycorn gives them the lie . 
Which does not make toward life , Charmian said . 
Very true , I answered . 
And that is the perfectest hell of it . 
John Barleycorn makes toward death . 
That is why I voted for the amendment to day . 
I read back in my life and saw how the accessibility of alcohol had given me the taste for it . 
You see , comparatively few alcoholics are born in a generation . 
And by alcoholic I mean a man whose chemistry craves alcohol and drives him resistlessly to it . 
The great majority of habitual drinkers are born not only without desire for alcohol , but with actual repugnance toward it . 
Not the first , nor the twentieth , nor the hundredth drink , succeeded in giving them the liking . 
But they learned , just as men learn to smoke though it is far easier to learn to smoke than to learn to drink . 
They learned because alcohol was so accessible . 
The women know the game . 
They pay for it the wives and sisters and mothers . 
And when they come to vote , they will vote for prohibition . 
And the best of it is that there will be no hardship worked on the coming generation . 
Not having access to alcohol , not being predisposed toward alcohol , it will never miss alcohol . 
Why not write all this up for the sake of the men and women coming ? Charmian asked . 
No , said Charmian , ignoring John Barleycorn's roughness , as so many women have learned to do . 
You have shown yourself no alcoholic , no dipsomaniac , but merely an habitual drinker , one who has made John Barleycorn's acquaintance through long years of rubbing shoulders with him . 
Write it up and call it 'Alcoholic Memoirs . 
In the first place , I am a seasoned drinker . 
I have no constitutional predisposition for alcohol . 
I am not a swine . 
I know the drinking game from A to Z , and I have used my judgment in drinking . 
I never have to be put to bed . 
In short , I am a normal , average man and I drink in the normal , average way , as drinking goes . 
And this is the very point I am writing of the effects of alcohol on the normal , average man . 
I have no word to say for or about the microscopically unimportant excessivist , the dipsomaniac . 
There are , broadly speaking , two types of drinkers . 
He is the type that gives rise to the jokes in the funny papers . 
The other type of drinker has imagination , vision . 
Even when most pleasantly jingled , he walks straight and naturally , never staggers nor falls , and knows just where he is and what he is doing . 
It is not his body but his brain that is drunken . 
He may bubble with wit , or expand with good fellowship . 
Or he may see intellectual spectres and phantoms that are cosmic and logical and that take the forms of syllogisms . 
It is when in this condition that he strips away the husks of life's healthiest illusions and gravely considers the iron collar of necessity welded about the neck of his soul . 
This is the hour of John Barleycorn's subtlest power . 
It is easy for any man to roll in the gutter . 
, when he knows that he may know only the laws of things the meaning of things never . 
This is his danger hour . 
His feet are taking hold of the pathway that leads down into the grave . 
All is clear to him . 
All these baffling head reaches after immortality are but the panics of souls frightened by the fear of death , and cursed with the thrice cursed gift of imagination . 
They have not the instinct for death they lack the will to die when the time to die is at hand . 
They trick themselves into believing they will outwit the game and win to a future , leaving the other animals to the darkness of the grave or the annihilating heats of the crematory . 
But he , this man in the hour of his white logic , knows that they trick and outwit themselves . 
The one event happeneth to all alike . 
There is no new thing under the sun , not even that yearned for bauble of feeble souls immortality . 
But he knows , HE knows , standing upright on his two legs unswaying . 
Of course , all this is soul sickness , life sickness . 
It is the penalty the imaginative man must pay for his friendship with John Barleycorn . 
The penalty paid by the stupid man is simpler , easier . 
He drinks himself into sottish unconsciousness . 
He sleeps a drugged sleep , and , if he dream , his dreams are dim and inarticulate . 
But to the imaginative man , John Barleycorn sends the pitiless , spectral syllogisms of the white logic . 
He looks upon life and all its affairs with the jaundiced eye of a pessimistic German philosopher . 
He sees through all illusions . 
Good is bad , truth is a cheat , and life is a joke . 
From his calm mad heights , with the certitude of a god , he beholds all life as evil . 
Wife , children , friends in the clear , white light of his logic they are exposed as frauds and shams . 
He sees through them , and all that he sees is their frailty , their meagreness , their sordidness , their pitifulness . 
No longer do they fool him . 
They are miserable little egotisms , like all the other little humans , fluttering their May fly life dance of an hour . 
They are puppets of chance . 
But there is one difference . 
And he knows his one freedom he may anticipate the day of his death . 
All of which is not good for a man who is made to live and love and be loved . 
Yet suicide , quick or slow , a sudden spill or a gradual oozing away through the years , is the price John Barleycorn exacts . 
No friend of his ever escapes making the just , due payment . 
CHAPTER III I was five years old the first time I got drunk . 
It was on a hot day , and my father was ploughing in the field . 
I was sent from the house , half a mile away , to carry to him a pail of beer . 
And be sure you don't spill it , was the parting injunction . 
It was , as I remember it , a lard pail , very wide across the top , and without a cover . 
As I toddled along , the beer slopped over the rim upon my legs . 
And as I toddled , I pondered . 
Beer was a very precious thing . 
Come to think of it , it must be wonderfully good . 
Else why was I never permitted to drink of it in the house ? Other things kept from me by the grown ups I had found good . 
Then this , too , was good . 
And , anyway , the pail was too full . 
I was slopping it against my legs and spilling it on the ground . 
Why waste it ? And no one would know whether I had drunk or spilled it . 
I was so small that , in order to negotiate the pail , I sat down and gathered it into my lap . 
First I sipped the foam . 
Evidently it did not reside in the foam . 
Besides , the taste was not good . 
Then I remembered seeing the grown ups blow the foam away before they drank . 
I buried my face in the foam and lapped the solid liquid beneath . 
It wasn't good at all . 
The grown ups knew what they were about . 
Also , I was gulping it down like medicine , in nauseous haste to get the ordeal over . 
I shuddered when I started on , and decided that the good taste would come afterward . 
I tried several times more in the course of that long half mile . 
And my father never noticed . 
He emptied the pail with the wide thirst of the sweating ploughman , returned it to me , and started up the plough . 
I endeavoured to walk beside the horses . 
He told me afterward that it was by only a matter of inches that I escaped disembowelling . 
I slept the afternoon away under the trees , and when my father roused me at sundown it was a very sick little boy that got up and dragged wearily homeward . 
I was exhausted , oppressed by the weight of my limbs , and in my stomach was a harp like vibrating that extended to my throat and brain . 
My condition was like that of one who had gone through a battle with poison . 
In truth , I had been poisoned . 
In the weeks and months that followed I had no more interest in beer than in the kitchen stove after it had burned me . 
The grown ups were right . 
Beer was not for children . 
The grown ups didn't mind it but neither did they mind taking pills and castor oil . 
As for me , I could manage to get along quite well without beer . 
Yes , and to the day of my death I could have managed to get along quite well without it . 
At every turn in the world in which I lived , John Barleycorn beckoned . 
There was no escaping him . 
All paths led to him . 
And it took twenty years of contact , of exchanging greetings and passing on with my tongue in my cheek , to develop in me a sneaking liking for the rascal . 
CHAPTER IV My next bout with John Barleycorn occurred when I was seven . 
This time my imagination was at fault , and I was frightened into the encounter . 
Still farming , my family had moved to a ranch on the bleak sad coast of San Mateo County , south of San Francisco . 
It was a wild , primitive countryside in those days and often I heard my mother pride herself that we were old American stock and not immigrant Irish and Italians like our neighbours . 
In all our section there was only one other old American family . 
One Sunday morning found me , how or why I cannot now remember , at the Morrisey ranch . 
A number of young people had gathered there from the nearer ranches . 
Besides , the oldsters had been there , drinking since early dawn , and , some of them , since the night before . 
The Morriseys were a huge breed , and there were many strapping great sons and uncles , heavy booted , big fisted , rough voiced . 
Suddenly there were screams from the girls and cries of Fight ! There was a rush . 
Men hurled themselves out of the kitchen . 
Two giants , flush faced , with greying hair , were locked in each other's arms . 
One was Black Matt , who , everybody said , had killed two men in his time . 
The women screamed softly , crossed themselves , or prayed brokenly , hiding their eyes and peeping through their fingers . 
But not I. It is a fair presumption that I was the most interested spectator . 
Maybe I would see that wonderful thing , a man killed . 
Anyway , I would see a man fight . 
Black Matt and Tom Morrisey merely held on to each other and lifted their clumsy booted feet in what seemed a grotesque , elephantine dance . 
They were too drunk to fight . 
Then the peacemakers got hold of them and led them back to cement the new friendship in the kitchen . 
Soon they were all talking at once , rumbling and roaring as big chested open air men will , when whisky has whipped their taciturnity . 
And I marvelled at Black Matt and Tom Morrisey , sprawled over the table , arms about each other's necks , weeping lovingly . 
The kitchen drinking continued , and the girls outside grew timorous . 
They knew the drink game , and all were certain that something terrible was going to happen . 
Immediately they paired off , lad and lassie , and started down the sandy road . 
And each lad walked with his sweetheart trust a child of seven to listen and to know the love affairs of his countryside . 
And behold , I , too , was a lad with a lassie . 
A little Irish girl of my own age had been paired off with me . 
We were the only children in this spontaneous affair . 
Perhaps the oldest couple might have been twenty . 
There were chits of girls , quite grown up , of fourteen and sixteen , walking with their fellows . 
And I was very proud , on that bright Sunday morning , going down the long bleak road among the sandhills . 
I , too , had my girl , and was a little man . 
The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment . 
Our visit was hailed with delight . 
The red wine was poured in tumblers for all , and the long dining room was partly cleared for dancing . 
And the young fellows drank and danced with the girls to the strains of an accordion . 
To me that music was divine . 
I had never heard anything so glorious . 
The young Italian who furnished it would even get up and dance , his arms around his girl , playing the accordion behind her back . 
All of which was very wonderful for me , who did not dance , but who sat at a table and gazed wide eyed at the amazingness of life . 
I was only a little lad , and there was so much of life for me to learn . 
As the time passed , the Irish lads began helping themselves to the wine , and jollity and high spirits reigned . 
I noted that some of them staggered and fell down in the dances , and that one had gone to sleep in a corner . 
Also , some of the girls were complaining , and wanting to leave , and others of the girls were titteringly complacent , willing for anything to happen . 
When our Italian hosts had offered me wine in a general sort of way , I had declined . 
My beer experience had been enough for me , and I had no inclination to traffic further in the stuff , or in anything related to it . 
He was sitting across the table from me . 
His face grew stern , and he insistently proffered the wine . 
And then terror descended upon me a terror which I must explain . 
First , she steadfastly maintained that brunettes and all the tribe of dark eyed humans were deceitful . 
Needless to say , my mother was a blonde . 
Next , she was convinced that the dark eyed Latin races were profoundly sensitive , profoundly treacherous , and profoundly murderous . 
That was her particular phrase stab you in the back . 
I had not yet learned to distinguish between facts and theories . 
My faith was implicit in my mother's exposition of the Italian character . 
Besides , I had some glimmering inkling of the sacredness of hospitality . 
Here was a treacherous , sensitive , murderous Italian , offering me hospitality . 
Then , too , this Italian , Peter , had those terrible black eyes I had heard my mother talk about . 
They were eyes different from the eyes I knew , from the blues and greys and hazels of my own family , from the pale and genial blues of the Irish . 
Perhaps Peter had had a few drinks . 
At any rate , his eyes were brilliantly black and sparkling with devilry . 
The expression in his eyes changed . 
They grew stern and imperious as he shoved the tumbler of wine closer . 
What could I do ? I have faced real death since in my life , but never have I known the fear of death as I knew it then . 
I put the glass to my lips , and Peter's eyes relented . 
I knew he would not kill me just then . 
But the wine was not . 
It was cheap , new wine , bitter and sour , made of the leavings and scrapings of the vineyards and the vats , and it tasted far worse than beer . 
There is only one way to take medicine , and that is to take it . 
And that is the way I took that wine . 
I threw my head back and gulped it down . 
I had to gulp again and hold the poison down , for poison it was to my child's tissues and membranes . 
Looking back now , I can realise that Peter was astounded . 
He half filled a second tumbler and shoved it across the table . 
Frozen with fear , in despair at the fate which had befallen me , I gulped the second glass down like the first . 
This was too much for Peter . 
He must share the infant prodigy he had discovered . 
He called Dominick , a young moustached Italian , to see the sight . 
This time it was a full tumbler that was given me . 
One will do anything to live . 
I gripped myself , mastered the qualms that rose in my throat , and downed the stuff . 
Dominick had never seen an infant of such heroic calibre . 
Twice again he refilled the tumbler , each time to the brim , and watched it disappear down my throat . 
By this time my exploits were attracting attention . 
Middle aged Italian labourers , old country peasants who did not talk English , and who could not dance with the Irish girls , surrounded me . 
They were swarthy and wild looking they wore belts and red shirts and I knew they carried knives and they ringed me around like a pirate chorus . 
And Peter and Dominick made me show off for them . 
Had I lacked imagination , had I been stupid , had I been stubbornly mulish in having my own way , I should never have got in this pickle . 
And the lads and lassies were dancing , and there was no one to save me from my fate . 
How much I drank I do not know . 
Bad as the wine was , a knife in the back was worse , and I must survive at any cost . 
Looking back with the drinker's knowledge , I know now why I did not collapse stupefied upon the table . 
As I have said , I was frozen , I was paralysed , with fear . 
The only movement I made was to convey that never ending procession of glasses to my lips . 
I was a poised and motionless receptacle for all that quantity of wine . 
It lay inert in my fear inert stomach . 
I was too frightened , even , for my stomach to turn . 
So all that Italian crew looked on and marvelled at the infant phenomenon that downed wine with the sang froid of an automaton . 
It is not in the spirit of braggadocio that I dare to assert they had never seen anything like it . 
The time came to go . 
The tipsy antics of the lads had led a majority of the soberer minded lassies to compel a departure . 
I found myself , at the door , beside my little maiden . 
She had not had my experience , so she was sober . 
She was fascinated by the titubations of the lads who strove to walk beside their girls , and began to mimic them . 
I thought this a great game , and I , too , began to stagger tipsily . 
But she had no wine to stir up , while my movements quickly set the fumes rising to my head . 
Even at the start , I was more realistic than she . 
In several minutes I was astonishing myself . 
To me this was excruciatingly funny . 
I staggered to the edge of the ditch , fully intending to stop on the edge . 
I came to myself , in the ditch , in process of being hauled out by several anxious faced girls . 
I didn't care to play at being drunk any more . 
There was no more fun in me . 
My eyes were beginning to swim , and with wide open mouth I panted for air . 
A girl led me by the hand on either side , but my legs were leaden . 
The alcohol I had drunk was striking my heart and brain like a club . 
Had I been a weakling of a child , I am confident that it would have killed me . 
As it was , I know I was nearer death than any of the scared girls dreamed . 
I could hear them bickering among themselves as to whose fault it was some were weeping for themselves , for me , and for the disgraceful way their lads had behaved . 
But I was not interested . 
I was suffocating , and I wanted air . 
It made me pant harder . 
Yet those girls persisted in making me walk , and it was four miles home . 
Four miles ! I remember my swimming eyes saw a small bridge across the road an infinite distance away . 
In fact , it was not a hundred feet distant . 
When I reached it , I sank down and lay on my back panting . 
The girls tried to lift me , but I was helpless and suffocating . 
Their cries of alarm brought Larry , a drunken youth of seventeen , who proceeded to resuscitate me by jumping on my chest . 
Dimly I remember this , and the squalling of the girls as they struggled with him and dragged him away . 
And then I knew nothing , though I learned afterward that Larry wound up under the bridge and spent the night there . 
When I came to , it was dark . 
I had been carried unconscious for four miles and been put to bed . 
I was a sick child , and , despite the terrible strain on my heart and tissues , I continually relapsed into the madness of delirium . 
All the contents of the terrible and horrible in my child's mind spilled out . 
The most frightful visions were realities to me . 
I saw murders committed , and I was pursued by murderers . 
I screamed and raved and fought . 
Emerging from such delirium , I would hear my mother's voice But the child's brain . 
He will lose his reason . 
And sinking back into delirium , I would take the idea with me and be immured in madhouses , and be beaten by keepers , and surrounded by screeching lunatics . 
One thing that had strongly impressed my young mind was the talk of my elders about the dens of iniquity in San Francisco's Chinatown . 
In my delirium I wandered deep beneath the ground through a thousand of these dens , and behind locked doors of iron I suffered and died a thousand deaths . 
I would rise in bed , struggling against the detaining hands , and curse my father till the rafters rang . 
It is a wonder that I did not burst my heart or brain that night . 
A seven year old child's arteries and nerve centres are scarcely fitted to endure the terrific paroxysms that convulsed me . 
No one slept in the thin , frame farm house that night when John Barleycorn had his will of me . 
And Larry , under the bridge , had no delirium like mine . 
But my brain was seared for ever by that experience . 
Writing now , thirty years afterward , every vision is as distinct , as sharp cut , every pain as vital and terrible , as on that night . 
I was sick for days afterward , and I needed none of my mother's injunctions to avoid John Barleycorn in the future . 
My mother had been dreadfully shocked . 
She held that I had done wrong , very wrong , and that I had gone contrary to all her teaching . 
And not until man grown did I tell her the true inwardness of that disgraceful affair . 
In those after days of sickness , I was confused on some points , and very clear on others . 
I felt guilty of sin , yet smarted with a sense of injustice . 
It had not been my fault , yet I had done wrong . 
But very clear was my resolution never to touch liquor again . 
No mad dog was ever more afraid of water than was I of alcohol . 
Yet the point I am making is that this experience , terrible as it was , could not in the end deter me from forming John Barleycorn's cheek by jowl acquaintance . 
All about me , even then , were the forces moving me toward him . 
In the first place , barring my mother , ever extreme in her views , it seemed to me all the grown ups looked upon the affair with tolerant eyes . 
It was a joke , something funny that had happened . 
There was no shame attached . 
As I say , so far as I could see , there was no shame anywhere . 
It had been something ticklishly , devilishly fine a bright and gorgeous episode in the monotony of life and labour on that bleak , fog girt coast . 
The Irish ranchers twitted me good naturedly on my exploit , and patted me on the back until I felt that I had done something heroic . 
Peter and Dominick and the other Italians were proud of my drinking prowess . 
The face of morality was not set against drinking . 
There was not a teetotaler in the community . 
Even the teacher of our little country school , a greying man of fifty , gave us vacations on the occasions when he wrestled with John Barleycorn and was thrown . 
Thus there was no spiritual deterrence . 
My loathing for alcohol was purely physiological . 
I didn't like the damned stuff . 
CHAPTER V This physical loathing for alcohol I have never got over . 
But I have conquered it . 
To this day I conquer it every time I take a drink . 
The palate never ceases to rebel , and the palate can be trusted to know what is good for the body . 
But men do not drink for the effect alcohol produces on the body . 
What they drink for is the brain effect and if it must come through the body , so much the worse for the body . 
And yet , despite my physical loathing for alcohol , the brightest spots in my child life were the saloons . 
The bright vision was the saloon at Colma , where my father , or whoever drove , always got out to get a drink . 
And I got out to warm by the great stove and get a soda cracker . 
Just one soda cracker , but a fabulous luxury . 
Saloons were good for something . 
Back behind the plodding horses , I would take an hour in consuming that one cracker . 
I took the smallest nibbles , never losing a crumb , and chewed the nibble till it became the thinnest and most delectable of pastes . 
I never voluntarily swallowed this paste . 
Horace Fletcher had nothing on me when it came to soda crackers . 
Especially I liked the San Francisco saloons . 
They had the most delicious dainties for the taking strange breads and crackers , cheeses , sausages , sardines wonderful foods that I never saw on our meagre home table . 
And once , I remember , a barkeeper mixed me a sweet temperance drink of syrup and soda water . 
My father did not pay for it . 
It was the barkeeper's treat , and he became my ideal of a good , kind man . 
I dreamed day dreams of him for years . 
Although I was seven years old at the time , I can see him now with undiminished clearness , though I never laid eyes on him but that one time . 
The saloon was south of Market Street in San Francisco . 
It stood on the west side of the street . 
As you entered , the bar was on the left . 
On the right , against the wall , was the free lunch counter . 
It was a long , narrow room , and at the rear , beyond the beer kegs on tap , were small , round tables and chairs . 
The barkeeper was blue eyed , and had fair , silky hair peeping out from under a black silk skull cap . 
He and my father talked long , and I sipped my sweet drink and worshipped him . 
And for years afterward I worshipped the memory of him . 
Despite my two disastrous experiences , here was John Barleycorn , prevalent and accessible everywhere in the community , luring and drawing me . 
Here were connotations of the saloon making deep indentations in a child's mind . 
Here was a child , forming its first judgments of the world , finding the saloon a delightful and desirable place . 
Their doors were ever closed to me the saloon's doors were ever open . 
Yes , the saloon was a mighty fine place , and it was more than that . 
By the time I was ten years old , my family had abandoned ranching and gone to live in the city . 
And here , at ten , I began on the streets as a newsboy . 
One of the reasons for this was that we needed the money . 
Another reason was that I needed the exercise . 
I had found my way to the free public library , and was reading myself into nervous prostration . 
On the poor ranches on which I had lived there had been no books . 
In ways truly miraculous , I had been lent four books , marvellous books , and them I had devoured . 
One was the life of Garfield the second , Paul du Chaillu's African travels the third , a novel by Ouida with the last forty pages missing and the fourth , Irving's Alhambra . 
This last had been lent me by a school teacher . 
I was not a forward child . 
Unlike Oliver Twist , I was incapable of asking for more . 
When I returned the Alhambra to the teacher I hoped she would lend me another book . 
And because she did not most likely she deemed me unappreciative I cried all the way home on the three mile tramp from the school to the ranch . 
I waited and yearned for her to lend me another book . 
Scores of times I nerved myself almost to the point of asking her , but never quite reached the necessary pitch of effrontery . 
And then came the city of Oakland , and on the shelves of that free library I discovered all the great world beyond the skyline . 
Here were thousands of books as good as my four wonder books , and some were even better . 
Libraries were not concerned with children in those days , and I had strange adventures . 
I remember , in the catalogue , being impressed by the title , The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle . 
I filled an application blank and the librarian handed me the collected and entirely unexpurgated works of Smollett in one huge volume . 
I read everything , but principally history and adventure , and all the old travels and voyages . 
I read mornings , afternoons , and nights . 
I read in bed , I read at table , I read as I walked to and from school , and I read at recess while the other boys were playing . 
I began to get the jerks . 
To everybody I replied Go away . 
And so , at ten , I was out on the streets , a newsboy . 
I had no time to read . 
I was busy getting exercise and learning how to fight , busy learning forwardness , and brass and bluff . 
I had an imagination and a curiosity about all things that made me plastic . 
Not least among the things I was curious about was the saloon . 
And I was in and out of many a one . 
I remember , in those days , on the east side of Broadway , between Sixth and Seventh , from corner to corner , there was a solid block of saloons . 
In the saloons life was different . 
Men talked with great voices , laughed great laughs , and there was an atmosphere of greatness . 
Here was something more than common every day where nothing happened . 
Here life was always very live , and , sometimes , even lurid , when blows were struck , and blood was shed , and big policemen came shouldering in . 
Great moments , these , for me , my head filled with all the wild and valiant fighting of the gallant adventurers on sea and land . 
There were no big moments when I trudged along the street throwing my papers in at doors . 
But in the saloons , even the sots , stupefied , sprawling across the tables or in the sawdust , were objects of mystery and wonder . 
And more , the saloons were right . 
The city fathers sanctioned them and licensed them . 
They were not the terrible places I heard boys deem them who lacked my opportunities to know . 
Terrible they might be , but then that only meant they were terribly wonderful , and it is the terribly wonderful that a boy desires to know . 
They put the seal of social approval on the saloon . 
They verified my own feeling of fascination in the saloon . 
They , too , must have found there that something different , that something beyond , which I sensed and groped after . 
What it was , I did not know yet there it must be , for there men focused like buzzing flies about a honey pot . 
I had no sorrows , and the world was very bright , so I could not guess that what these men sought was forgetfulness of jaded toil and stale grief . 
Not that I drank at that time . 
From ten to fifteen I rarely tasted liquor , but I was intimately in contact with drinkers and drinking places . 
The only reason I did not drink was because I didn't like the stuff . 
Big jovial Josie Harper ran a road house at Telegraph Avenue and Thirty ninth Street . 
Here for a year I delivered an evening paper , until my route was changed to the water front and tenderloin of Oakland . 
The first month , when I collected Josie Harper's bill , she poured me a glass of wine . 
I was ashamed to refuse , so I drank it . 
But after that I watched the chance when she wasn't around so as to collect from her barkeeper . 
The others asked for beer . 
I said I'd take ginger ale . 
The boys snickered , and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange , searching scrutiny . 
Nevertheless , he opened a bottle of ginger ale . 
Afterward , back in the alleys , in the pauses between games , the boys enlightened me . 
I had offended the barkeeper . 
Besides , beer was food . 
I could work better on it . 
There was no food in ginger ale . 
After that , when I couldn't sneak out of it , I drank beer and wondered what men found in it that was so good . 
I was always aware that I was missing something . 
What I really liked in those days was candy . 
For five cents I could buy five cannon balls big lumps of the most delicious lastingness . 
I could chew and worry a single one for an hour . 
Then there was a Mexican who sold big slabs of brown chewing taffy for five cents each . 
It required a quarter of a day properly to absorb one of them . 
And many a day I made my entire lunch off one of those slabs . 
In truth , I found food there , but not in beer . 
CHAPTER VI But the time was rapidly drawing near when I was to begin my second series of bouts with John Barleycorn . 
I wanted to go to sea . 
I wanted to get away from monotony and the commonplace . 
I was in the flower of my adolescence , a thrill with romance and adventure , dreaming of wild life in the wild man world . 
Little I guessed how all the warp and woof of that man world was entangled with alcohol . 
So , one day , as I hoisted sail on my skiff , I met Scotty . 
He was a husky youngster of seventeen , a runaway apprentice , he told me , from an English ship in Australia . 
He had just worked his way on another ship to San Francisco and now he wanted to see about getting a berth on a whaler . 
Across the estuary , near where the whalers lay , was lying the sloop yacht Idler . 
The caretaker was a harpooner who intended sailing next voyage on the whale ship Bonanza . 
And the harpooner who was caretaker ! How often had I seen him and envied him his freedom . 
He never had to leave the water . 
He slept aboard the Idler each night , while I had to go home upon the land to go to bed . 
but he had been too shining and glorious a personality for me ever to address as I paddled around the yacht at a wistful distance . 
It was the first sea interior I had ever seen . 
The clothing on the wall smelled musty . 
But what of that ? Was it not the sea gear of men ? leather jackets lined with corduroy , blue coats of pilot cloth , sou'westers , sea boots , oilskins . 
And everywhere was in evidence the economy of space the narrow bunks , the swinging tables , the incredible lockers . 
At last I was living . 
Here I sat , inside my first ship , a smuggler , accepted as a comrade by a harpooner and a runaway English sailor who said his name was Scotty . 
The first thing that the harpooner , aged nineteen , and the sailor , aged seventeen , did to show that they were men was to behave like men . 
The harpooner suggested the eminent desirableness of a drink , and Scotty searched his pockets for dimes and nickels . 
Then the harpooner carried away a pink flask to be filled in some blind pig , for there were no licensed saloons in that locality . 
We drank the cheap rotgut out of tumblers . 
Was I any the less strong , any the less valiant , than the harpooner and the sailor ? They were men . 
They proved it by the way they drank . 
Drink was the badge of manhood . 
So I drank with them , drink by drink , raw and straight , though the damned stuff couldn't compare with a stick of chewing taffy or a delectable cannon ball . 
I shuddered and swallowed my gorge with every drink , though I manfully hid all such symptoms . 
Divers times we filled the flask that afternoon . 
All I had was twenty cents , but I put it up like a man , though with secret regret at the enormous store of candy it could have bought . 
You can't swim in that ice water , said the harpooner confidentially to me . 
You double up in a minute and go down . 
When a whale smashes your boat , the thing to do is to get your belly across an oar , so that when the cold doubles you you'll float . 
Sure , I said , with a grateful nod and an air of certitude that I , too , would hunt whales and be in smashed boats in the Arctic Ocean . 
And , truly , I registered his advice as singularly valuable information , and filed it away in my brain , where it persists to this day . 
But I couldn't talk at first . 
Heavens ! I was only fourteen , and had never been on the ocean in my life . 
I could only listen to the two sea dogs , and show my manhood by drinking with them , fairly and squarely , drink and drink . 
Our inhibitions and taciturnities vanished . 
We were as if we had known each other for years and years , and we pledged ourselves to years of future voyagings together . 
The harpooner told of misadventures and secret shames . 
He drew her last sad letter from his pocket and wept over it as he read it aloud . 
The best of it was that my assertion and brag were true . 
With reticence and modesty present , I could never have dared tell Scotty my small boat estimate of him . 
But it is ever the way of John Barleycorn to loosen the tongue and babble the secret thought . 
Scotty , or John Barleycorn , or the pair , was very naturally offended by my remarks . 
I could whip any runaway sailor seventeen years old . 
Scotty and I flared and raged like young cockerels , until the harpooner poured another round of drinks to enable us to forgive and make up . 
Which we did , arms around each other's necks , protesting vows of eternal friendship just like Black Matt and Tom Morrisey , I remembered , in the ranch kitchen in San Mateo . 
By this time the singing stage was reached , and I joined Scotty and the harpooner in snatches of sea songs and chanties . 
It was here , in the cabin of the Idler , that I first heard Blow the Man Down , Flying Cloud , and Whisky , Johnny , Whisky . 
Oh , it was brave . 
I was beginning to grasp the meaning of life . 
Here was no commonplace , no Oakland Estuary , no weary round of throwing newspapers at front doors , delivering ice , and setting up ninepins . 
We were three tipsy young gods , incredibly wise , gloriously genial , and without limit to our powers . 
Ah ! and I say it now , after the years could John Barleycorn keep one at such a height , I should never draw a sober breath again . 
But this is not a world of free freights . 
One pays according to an iron schedule for every strength the balanced weakness for every high a corresponding low for every fictitious god like moment an equivalent time in reptilian slime . 
For every feat of telescoping long days and weeks of life into mad magnificent instants , one must pay with shortened life , and , oft times , with savage usury added . 
Intenseness and duration are as ancient enemies as fire and water . 
And John Barleycorn , mighty necromancer though he be , is as much a slave to organic chemistry as we mortals are . 
We pay for every nerve marathon we run , nor can John Barleycorn intercede and fend off the just payment . 
He can lead us to the heights , but he cannot keep us there , else would we all be devotees . 
And there is no devotee but pays for the mad dances John Barleycorn pipes . 
Yet the foregoing is all in after wisdom spoken . 
I had a splendid constitution , a stomach that would digest scrap iron , and I was still running my marathon in full vigour when Scotty began to fail and fade . 
He groped for words and could not find them , while the ones he found his lips were unable to form . 
His poisoned consciousness was leaving him . 
The brightness went out of his eyes , and he looked as stupid as were his efforts to talk . 
His face and body sagged as his consciousness sagged . 
Scotty's reeling brain could not control his muscles . 
All his correlations were breaking down . 
He strove to take another drink , and feebly dropped the tumbler on the floor . 
Then , to my amazement , weeping bitterly , he rolled into a bunk on his back and immediately snored off to sleep . 
The harpooner and I drank on , grinning in a superior way to each other over Scotty's plight . 
The last flask was opened , and we drank it between us , to the accompaniment of Scotty's stertorous breathing . 
Then the harpooner faded away into his bunk , and I was left alone , unthrown , on the field of battle . 
I was very proud , and John Barleycorn was proud with me . 
I could carry my drink . 
I had drunk two men , drink for drink , into unconsciousness . 
And I was still on my two feet , upright , making my way on deck to get air into my scorching lungs . 
The fortunate man is the one who cannot take more than a couple of drinks without becoming intoxicated . 
The unfortunate wight is the one who can take many glasses without betraying a sign , who must take numerous glasses in order to get the kick . 
The sun was setting when I came on the Idler's deck . 
There were plenty of bunks below . 
I did not need to go home . 
But I wanted to demonstrate to myself how much I was a man . 
There lay my skiff astern . 
The last of a strong ebb was running out in channel in the teeth of an ocean breeze of forty miles an hour . 
I could see the stiff whitecaps , and the suck and run of the current was plainly visible in the face and trough of each one . 
I set sail , cast off , took my place at the tiller , the sheet in my hand , and headed across channel . 
The skiff heeled over and plunged into it madly . 
The spray began to fly . 
I was at the pinnacle of exaltation . 
I sang Blow the Man Down as I sailed . 
I was no boy of fourteen , living the mediocre ways of the sleepy town called Oakland . 
I was a man , a god , and the very elements rendered me allegiance as I bitted them to my will . 
A full hundred yards of soft mud intervened between the boat wharf and the water . 
It was then that my correlations began to break down . 
I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze . 
But what of it ? Across the channel two strong sailormen lay unconscious in their bunks where I had drunk them . 
I was still on my legs , if they were knee deep in mud . 
I disdained to get back into the skiff . 
I waded through the mud , shoving the skiff before me and yammering the chant of my manhood to the world . 
I was sick for a couple of days , meanly sick , and my arms were painfully poisoned from the barnacle scratches . 
For a week I could not use them , and it was a torture to put on and take off my clothes . 
I swore , Never again ! The game wasn't worth it . 
The price was too stiff . 
I had no moral qualms . 
My revulsion was purely physical . 
No exalted moments were worth such hours of misery and wretchedness . 
When I got back to my skiff , I shunned the Idler . 
I would cross the opposite side of the channel to go around her . 
The harpooner was still about , but him I avoided . 
Once , when he landed on the boat wharf , I hid in a shed so as to escape seeing him . 
I was afraid he would propose some more drinking , maybe have a flask full of whisky in his pocket . 
And yet and here enters the necromancy of John Barleycorn that afternoon's drunk on the Idler had been a purple passage flung into the monotony of my days . 
My mind dwelt on it continually . 
I went over the details , over and over again . 
Among other things , I had got into the cogs and springs of men's actions . 
I had seen Scotty weep about his own worthlessness and the sad case of his Edinburgh mother who was a lady . 
The harpooner had told me terribly wonderful things of himself . 
I had caught a myriad enticing and inflammatory hints of a world beyond my world , and for which I was certainly as fitted as the two lads who had drunk with me . 
I had got behind men's souls . 
I had got behind my own soul and found unguessed potencies and greatnesses . 
Yes , that day stood out above all my other days . 
To this day it so stands out . 
The memory of it is branded in my brain . 
But the price exacted was too high . 
I refused to play and pay , and returned to my cannon balls and taffy slabs . 
The point is that all the chemistry of my healthy , normal body drove me away from alcohol . 
The stuff didn't agree with me . 
And detest and hate him all the time . 
Yes , he is a strange friend , John Barleycorn . 
CHAPTER VII I was barely turned fifteen , and working long hours in a cannery . 
Month in and month out , the shortest day I ever worked was ten hours . 
Out of those nine hours , after I was in bed and ere my eyes drowsed shut , I managed to steal a little time for reading . 
But many a night I did not knock off work until midnight . 
On occasion I worked eighteen and twenty hours on a stretch . 
Once I worked at my machine for thirty six consecutive hours . 
No moments here to be stolen for my beloved books . 
And what had John Barleycorn to do with such strenuous , Stoic toil of a lad just turned fifteen ? He had everything to do with it . 
I asked myself if this were the meaning of life to be a work beast ? I knew of no horse in the city of Oakland that worked the hours I worked . 
If this were living , I was entirely unenamoured of it . 
There was only one way to escape my deadening toil . 
I must get out and away on the water . 
I must earn my bread on the water . 
And the way of the water led inevitably to John Barleycorn . 
I did not know this . 
And when I did learn it , I was courageous enough not to retreat back to my bestial life at the machine . 
I wanted to be where the winds of adventure blew . 
Every raid on an oyster bed was a felony . 
The penalty was State imprisonment , the stripes and the lockstep . 
And what of that ? The men in stripes worked a shorter day than I at my machine . 
And there was vastly more romance in being an oyster pirate or a convict than in being a machine slave . 
And behind it all , behind all of me with youth abubble , whispered Romance , Adventure . 
So I interviewed my Mammy Jennie , my old nurse at whose black breast I had suckled . 
She was more prosperous than my folks . 
She was nursing sick people at a good weekly wage . 
Would she lend her white child the money ? WOULD SHE ? What she had was mine . 
Then I sought out French Frank , the oyster pirate , who wanted to sell , I had heard , his sloop , the Razzle Dazzle . 
I found him lying at anchor on the Alameda side of the estuary near the Webster Street bridge , with visitors aboard , whom he was entertaining with afternoon wine . 
He came on deck to talk business . 
He was willing to sell . 
Besides , he had guests . 
On the morrow he would make out the bill of sale and I could enter into possession . 
And in the meantime I must come below and meet his friends . 
Mamie , who was Spider's niece , was called the Queen of the Oyster Pirates , and , on occasion , presided at their revels . 
French Frank was in love with her , though I did not know it at the time and she steadfastly refused to marry him . 
French Frank poured a tumbler of red wine from a big demijohn to drink to our transaction . 
I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho , and shuddered inwardly . 
Whisky and beer were not quite so repulsive . 
But the Queen of the Oyster Pirates was looking at me , a part emptied glass in her own hand . 
If I was only fifteen , at least I could not show myself any less a man than she . 
Besides , there were her sister , and Mrs. Hadley , and the young oyster pirate , and the whiskered wharf rat , all with glasses in their hands . 
Was I a milk and water sop ? No a thousand times no , and a thousand glasses no . 
I downed the tumblerful like a man . 
French Frank was elated by the sale , which I had bound with a twenty dollar goldpiece . 
I had learned my strong head and stomach , and I was certain I could drink with them in a temperate way and not poison myself for a week to come . 
I could stand as much as they and besides , they had already been drinking for some time . 
Spider sang The Boston Burglar and Black Lulu . 
The Queen sang Then I Wisht I Were a Little Bird . 
And her sister Tess sang Oh , Treat My Daughter Kindily . 
The fun grew fast and furious . 
I found myself able to miss drinks without being noticed or called to account . 
Also , standing in the companionway , head and shoulders out and glass in hand , I could fling the wine overboard . 
I reasoned something like this It is a queerness of these people that they like this vile tasting wine . 
I cannot quarrel with their tastes . 
My manhood , according to their queer notions , must compel me to appear to like this wine . 
But I shall drink no more than is unavoidable . 
And the Queen began to make love to me , the latest recruit to the oyster pirate fleet , and no mere hand , but a master and owner . 
She went upon deck to take the air , and took me with her . 
She knew , of course , but I never dreamed , how French Frank was raging down below . 
Then Tess joined us , sitting on the cabin and Spider , and Bob and at the last , Mrs. Hadley and French Frank . 
And we sat there , glasses in hand , and sang , while the big demijohn went around and I was the only strictly sober one . 
And I enjoyed it as no one of them was able to enjoy it . 
And it was through John Barleycorn that I came to join this glorious company of free souls , unashamed and unafraid . 
And the afternoon seabreeze blew its tang into my lungs , and curled the waves in mid channel . 
Before it came the scow schooners , wing and wing , blowing their horns for the drawbridges to open . 
Red stacked tugs tore by , rocking the Razzle Dazzle in the waves of their wake . 
A sugar barque towed from the boneyard to sea . 
The sun wash was on the crisping water , and life was big . 
There it was , the smack and slap of the spirit of revolt , of adventure , of romance , of the things forbidden and done defiantly and grandly . 
And I knew that on the morrow I would not go back to my machine at the cannery . 
To morrow I would be an oyster pirate , as free a freebooter as the century and the waters of San Francisco Bay would permit . 
Spider had already agreed to sail with me as my crew of one , and , also , as cook while I did the deck work . 
, and beat our way out the estuary on the first of the seabreeze and the last of the ebb . 
Then we would slack sheets , and on the first of the flood run down the bay to the Asparagus Islands , where we would anchor miles off shore . 
And at last my dream would be realised I would sleep upon the water . 
And next morning I would wake upon the water and thereafter all my days and nights would be on the water . 
And the Queen asked me to row her ashore in my skiff , when at sunset French Frank prepared to take his guests ashore . 
Nor did I catch the significance of his abrupt change of plan when he turned the task of rowing his skiff over to Whisky Bob , himself remaining on board the sloop . 
Nor did I understand Spider's grinning side remark to me Gee ! There's nothin' slow about YOU . 
I paid the money over , received the bill of sale , and French Frank treated . 
But , to my surprise , French Frank treated the house . 
It was early morning , and all ordered whisky . 
And such whisky ! I tossed it down . 
A r r r gh ! I can taste it yet . 
And I was appalled at the price French Frank had paid eighty cents . 
EIGHTY CENTS ! It was an outrage to my thrifty soul . 
There was no discussion that French Frank was a waster . 
I was anxious to be gone , out into the sunshine , out over the water to my glorious boat . 
Even Spider , my crew , lingered . 
No hint broke through my obtuseness of why they lingered . 
I sensed the change in his attitude , saw the forbidding glitter in his eyes , and wondered . 
The more I saw of men , the queerer they became . 
Johnny Heinhold leaned across the bar and whispered in my ear s He's got it in for you . 
I nodded comprehension of his statement , and acquiescence in it , as a man should nod who knows all about men . 
But secretly I was perplexed . 
Keep your eyes open , he muttered . 
I'm going up river with him to get a schooner for oystering . 
When he gets down on the beds , watch out . 
He says he'll run you down . 
After dark , any time he's around , change your anchorage and douse your riding light . 
Savve ? Oh , certainly , I savve'd . 
I nodded my head , and , as one man to another , thanked him for his tip and drifted back to the group at the bar . 
No I did not treat . 
I never dreamed that I was expected to treat . 
I left with Spider , and my ears burn now as I try to surmise the things they must have said about me . 
I asked Spider , in an off hand way , what was eating French Frank . 
He's crazy jealous of you , was the answer . 
Do you think so ? I said , and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about . 
I had read of such things in books , and regarded them as personal probabilities of a distant maturity . 
Such was my escape from the killing machine toil , and my introduction to the oyster pirates . 
True , the introduction had begun with drink , and the life promised to continue with drink . 
But was I to stay away from it for such reason ? Wherever life ran free and great , there men drank . 
Romance and Adventure seemed always to go down the street locked arm in arm with John Barleycorn . 
To know the two , I must know the third . 
No I was not to be deterred from this brave life on the water by the fact that the water dwellers had queer and expensive desires for beer and wine and whisky . 
It was the price I would pay for their comradeship . 
And I didn't have to get drunk . 
I had not got drunk the Sunday afternoon I arranged to buy the Razzle Dazzle , despite the fact that not one of the rest was sober . 
Well , I could go on into the future that way , drinking the stuff when it gave them pleasure that I should drink it , but carefully avoiding over drinking . 
The more I saw of the life , the more I was enamoured of it . 
Oh , I know , looking back , that the whole thing was sordid and silly . 
But I was not looking back in those days when I was rubbing shoulders with John Barleycorn and beginning to accept him . 
The life was brave and wild , and I was living the adventure I had read so much about . 
Nelson , Young Scratch they called him , to distinguish him from Old Scratch , his father , sailed in the sloop Reindeer , partners with one Clam . 
Clam was a dare devil , but Nelson was a reckless maniac . 
He was twenty years old , with the body of a Hercules . 
When he was shot in Benicia , a couple of years later , the coroner said he was the greatest shouldered man he had ever seen laid on a slab . 
Nelson could not read or write . 
He had been dragged up by his father on San Francisco Bay , and boats were second nature with him . 
His strength was prodigious , and his reputation along the water front for violence was anything but savoury . 
He had Berserker rages and did mad , terrible things . 
He was some man , this Nelson and when , passing by the Last Chance saloon , he spoke to me , I felt very proud . 
But try to imagine my pride when he promptly asked me in to have a drink . 
We talked and lingered at the bar . 
It seemed to me strange that we lingered . 
We had had our beer . 
And still we talked , and Nelson evinced no intention of leaving the bar . 
Bear with me while I explain the way of my reasoning and of my innocence . 
First of all , I was very proud to be in the company of Nelson , who was the most heroic figure among the oyster pirates and bay adventurers . 
Unfortunately for my stomach and mucous membranes , Nelson had a strange quirk of nature that made him find happiness in treating me to beer . 
It was his whim to drink beer , and to have me drink beer with him . 
Very well , I would put up with the passing discomfort . 
So we continued to talk at the bar , and to drink beer ordered and paid for by Nelson . 
I think , now , when I look back upon it , that Nelson was curious . 
He wanted to find out just what kind of a gink I was . 
He wanted to see how many times I'd let him treat without offering to treat in return . 
After I had drunk half a dozen glasses , my policy of temperateness in mind , I decided that I had had enough for that time . 
So I mentioned that I was going aboard the Razzle Dazzle , then lying at the city wharf , a hundred yards away . 
I said good bye to Nelson , and went on down the wharf . 
But , John Barleycorn , to the extent of six glasses , went with me . 
My brain tingled and was very much alive . 
I was uplifted by my sense of manhood . 
I , a truly true oyster pirate , was going aboard my own boat after hob nobbing in the Last Chance with Nelson , the greatest oyster pirate of us all . 
Strong in my brain was the vision of us leaning against the bar and drinking beer . 
And curious it was , I decided , this whim of nature that made men happy in spending good money for beer for a fellow like me who didn't want it . 
I remembered , on the drunk on the Idler , how Scotty and the harpooner and myself had raked and scraped dimes and nickels with which to buy the whisky . 
That was why Nelson had lingered at the bar . 
Having bought a drink , he had waited for me to buy one . 
I HAD , LET HIM BUY SIX DRINKS AND NEVER ONCE OFFERED TO TREAT . 
And he was the great Nelson ! I could feel myself blushing with shame . 
I sat down on the stringer piece of the wharf and buried my face in my hands . 
And the heat of my shame burned up my neck and into my cheeks and forehead . 
I have blushed many times in my life , but never have I experienced so terrible a blush as that one . 
And sitting there on the stringer piece in my shame , I did a great deal of thinking and transvaluing of values . 
I had been born poor . 
I had gone hungry on occasion . 
I had never had toys nor playthings like other children . 
My first memories of life were pinched by poverty . 
The pinch of poverty had been chronic . 
I was eight years old when I wore my first little undershirt actually sold in a store across the counter . 
And then it had been only one little undershirt . 
When it was soiled I had to return to the awful home made things until it was washed . 
I had been so proud of it that I insisted on wearing it without any outer garment . 
For the first time I mutinied against my mother mutinied myself into hysteria , until she let me wear the store undershirt so all the world could see . 
Only a man who has undergone famine can properly value food only sailors and desert dwellers know the meaning of fresh water . 
And only a child , with a child's imagination , can come to know the meaning of things it has been long denied . 
I early discovered that the only things I could have were those I got for myself . 
My meagre childhood developed meagreness . 
The first things I had been able to get for myself had been cigarette pictures , cigarette posters , and cigarette albums . 
I had not had the spending of the money I earned , so I traded extra newspapers for these treasures . 
I traded duplicates with the other boys , and circulating , as I did , all about town , I had greater opportunities for trading and acquiring . 
And each series I had three different ways in the card from the cigarette package , in the poster , and in the album . 
Then I began to accumulate duplicate sets , duplicate albums . 
I traded for other things that boys valued and which they usually bought with money given them by their parents . 
Naturally , they did not have the keen sense of values that I had , who was never given money to buy anything . 
I'd trade anything and everything for anything else , and turn it over in a dozen more trades until it was transmuted into something that was worth something . 
I was famous as a trader . 
I was notorious as a miser . 
I could even make a junkman weep when I had dealings with him . 
I was now with men I admired . 
I was proud to be with them . 
They were magnificently careless of money , calling up eight men to drink whisky at ten cents a glass , as French Frank had done . 
Why , Nelson had just spent sixty cents on beer for the two of us . 
Which was it to be ? I was aware that I was making a grave decision . 
I was deciding between money and men , between niggardliness and romance . 
I retraced my steps up the wharf to the Last Chance , where Nelson still stood outside . 
Come on and have a beer , I invited . 
I had achieved a concept . 
It was comradeship that counted . 
Have another ? I said . 
And we had another , and I paid for it . 
Nelson , with the wisdom of the skilled drinker , said to the barkeeper , Make mine a small one , Johnny . 
Johnny nodded and gave him a glass that contained only a third as much as the glasses we had been drinking . 
Yet the charge was the same five cents . 
By this time I was getting nicely jingled , so such extravagance didn't hurt me much . 
Besides , I was learning . 
There was more in this buying of drinks than mere quantity . 
I got my finger on it . 
There was a stage when the beer didn't count at all , but just the spirit of comradeship of drinking together . 
And , ha ! another thing ! I , too , could call for small beers and minimise by two thirds the detestable freightage with which comradeship burdened one . 
Oh , well , you didn't have to do that , he answered . 
Johnny'll trust a fellow like you won't you , Johnny ! Sure , Johnny agreed , with a smile . 
How much you got down against me ? Nelson queried . 
Johnny pulled out the book he kept behind the bar , found Nelson's page , and added up the account of several dollars . 
At once I became possessed with a desire to have a page in that book . 
Almost it seemed the final badge of manhood . 
After a couple more drinks , for which I insisted on paying , Nelson decided to go . 
We parted true comradely , and I wandered down the wharf to the Razzle Dazzle . 
Spider was just building the fire for supper . 
Where'd you get it ? he grinned up at me through the open companion . 
Oh , I've been with Nelson , I said carelessly , trying to hide my pride . 
Then an idea came to me . 
Here was another one of them . 
Now that I had achieved my concept , I might as well practise it thoroughly . 
Come on , I said , up to Johnny's and have a drink . 
Going up the wharf , we met Clam coming down . 
Clam was Nelson's partner , and he was a fine , brave , handsome , moustached man of thirty everything , in short , that his nickname did not connote . 
Come on , I said , and have a drink . 
As we turned into the Last Chance , there was Pat , the Queen's brother , coming out . 
What's your hurry ? I greeted him . 
I've just had one , he demurred . 
What of it ? we're having one now , I retorted . 
And Pat consented to join us , and I melted my way into his good graces with a couple of glasses of beer . 
Oh ! I was learning things that afternoon about John Barleycorn . 
There was more in him than the bad taste when you swallowed him . 
Here , at the absurd cost of ten cents , a gloomy , grouchy individual , who threatened to become an enemy , was made into a good friend . 
He became even genial , his looks were kindly , and our voices mellowed together as we talked water front and oyster bed gossip . 
Small beer for me , Johnny , I said , when the others had ordered schooners . 
Yes , and I said it like the accustomed drinker , carelessly , casually , as a sort of spontaneous thought that had just occurred to me . 
Looking back , I am confident that the only one there who guessed I was a tyro at bar drinking was Johnny Heinhold . 
Where'd he get it ? I overheard Spider confidentially ask Johnny . 
Oh , he's been sousin' here with Nelson all afternoon , was Johnny's answer . 
I never let on that I'd heard , but PROUD ? Aye , even the barkeeper was giving me a recommendation as a man . 
HE'S BEEN SOUSIN' HERE WITH NELSON ALL AFTERNOON . 
Magic words ! The accolade delivered by a barkeeper with a beer glass ! I remembered that French Frank had treated Johnny the day I bought the Razzle Dazzle . 
The glasses were filled and we were ready to drink . 
Johnny looked at me with quick sharpness , divining , I am positive , the strides I was making in my education , and poured himself whisky from his private bottle . 
This hit me for a moment on my thrifty side . 
He had taken a ten cent drink when the rest of us were drinking five cent drinks ! But the hurt was only for a moment . 
I dismissed it as ignoble , remembered my concept , and did not give myself away . 
You'd better put me down in the book for this , I said , when we had finished the drink . 
And I had the satisfaction of seeing a fresh page devoted to my name and a charge pencilled for a round of drinks amounting to thirty cents . 
And I glimpsed , as through a golden haze , a future wherein that page would be much charged , and crossed off , and charged again . 
I treated a second time around , and then , to my amazement , Johnny redeemed himself in that matter of the ten cent drink . 
He treated us around from behind the bar , and I decided that he had arithmetically evened things up handsomely . 
Let's go around to the St . 
Louis House , Spider suggested when we got outside . 
Pat , who had been shovelling coal all day , had gone home , and Clam had gone upon the Reindeer to cook supper . 
So around Spider and I went to the St . 
Louis House my first visit a huge bar room , where perhaps fifty men , mostly longshoremen , were congregated . 
And there I met Soup Kennedy for the second time , and Bill Kelley . 
And Smith , of the Annie , drifted in he of the belt buckled revolvers . 
But what of it ? I thought , or rather , John Barleycorn thought it for me . 
You're a man and you're getting acquainted with men . 
Mammy Jennie doesn't need the money as promptly as all that . 
She's got other money in the bank . 
Let her wait , and pay her back gradually . 
And thus it was I learned another trait of John Barleycorn . 
Wrong conduct that it is impossible for one to do sober , is done quite easily when one is not sober . 
In fact , it is the only thing one can do , for John Barleycorn's inhibition rises like a wall between one's immediate desires and long learned morality . 
I dismissed my thought of debt to Mammy Jennie and proceeded to get acquainted at the trifling expense of some trifling money and a jingle that was growing unpleasant . 
Who took me on board and put me to bed that night I do not know , but I imagine it must have been Spider . 
CHAPTER X And so I won my manhood's spurs . 
My status on the water front and with the oyster pirates became immediately excellent . 
I was looked upon as a good fellow , as well as no coward . 
And somehow , from the day I achieved that concept sitting on the stringer piece of the Oakland City Wharf , I have never cared much for money . 
No one has ever considered me a miser since , while my carelessness of money is a source of anxiety and worry to some that know me . 
So completely did I break with my parsimonious past that I sent word home to my mother to call in the boys of the neighbourhood and give to them all my collections . 
I never even cared to learn what boys got what collections . 
I was a man now , and I made a clean sweep of everything that bound me to my boyhood . 
And I continued to show what was in me . 
But the things I did on the water only partly counted . 
I little dreamed that the time would come when the Oakland water front , which had shocked me at first would be shocked and annoyed by the devilry of the things I did . 
But always the life was tied up with drinking . 
The saloons are poor men's clubs . 
We engaged to meet one another in saloons . 
We celebrated our good fortune or wept our grief in saloons . 
We got acquainted in saloons . 
Can I ever forget the afternoon I met Old Scratch , Nelson's father ? It was in the Last Chance . 
That Old Scratch was Nelson's father was noteworthy enough . 
But there was more in it than that . 
He was owner and master of the scow schooner Annie Mine , and some day I might ship as a sailor with him . 
Still more , he was romance . 
He was a blue eyed , yellow haired , raw boned Viking , big bodied and strong muscled despite his age . 
And he had sailed the seas in ships of all nations in the old savage sailing days . 
I had heard many weird tales about him , and worshipped him from a distance . 
It took the saloon to bring us together . 
Even so , our acquaintance might have been no more than a hand grip and a word he was a laconic old fellow had it not been for the drinking . 
Have a drink , I said , with promptitude , after the pause which I had learned good form in drinking dictates . 
Of course , while we drank our beer , which I had paid for , it was incumbent on him to listen to me and to talk to me . 
And Johnny , like a true host , made the tactful remarks that enabled us to find mutual topics of conversation . 
And of course , having drunk my beer , Captain Nelson must now buy beer in turn . 
This led to more talking , and Johnny drifted out of the conversation to wait on other customers . 
The more beer Captain Nelson and I drank , the better we got acquainted . 
In me he found an appreciative listener , who , by virtue of book reading , knew much about the sea life he had lived . 
And it was only John Barleycorn that made possible that long afternoon with the old sea dog . 
It was Johnny Heinhold who secretly warned me across the bar that I was getting pickled and advised me to take small beers . 
But as long as Captain Nelson drank large beers , my pride forbade anything else than large beers . 
And not until the skipper ordered his first small beer did I order one for myself . 
Oh , when we came to a lingering fond farewell , I was drunk . 
But I had the satisfaction of seeing Old Scratch as drunk as I. My youthful modesty scarcely let me dare believe that the hardened old buccaneer was even more drunk . 
Which was the more remarkable , because he was known as a savage , cantankerous old cuss who never liked anybody . 
And that I had won his friendship , all thanks were due to John Barleycorn . 
I have given the incident merely as an example of the multitudinous lures and draws and services by which John Barleycorn wins his followers . 
CHAPTER XI And still there arose in me no desire for alcohol , no chemical demand . 
In years and years of heavy drinking , drinking did not beget the desire . 
Drinking was the way of the life I led , the way of the men with whom I lived . 
While away on my cruises on the bay , I took no drink along and while out on the bay the thought of the desirableness of a drink never crossed my mind . 
It was my boat , I was host , and I could only dispense hospitality in the terms of their understanding of it . 
So I would rush Spider , or Irish , or Scotty , or whoever was my crew , with the can for beer and the demijohn for red wine . 
And again , lying at the wharf disposing of my oysters , there were dusky twilights when big policemen and plain clothes men stole on board . 
Drink as I would , I couldn't come to like John Barleycorn . 
I valued him extremely well for his associations , but not for the taste of him . 
All the time I was striving to be a man amongst men , and all the time I nursed secret and shameful desires for candy . 
But I would have died before I'd let anybody guess it . 
I used to indulge in lonely debauches , on nights when I knew my crew was going to sleep ashore . 
And those were the only times I felt that I got my real money's worth . 
Dollars and dollars , across the bar , couldn't buy the satisfaction that twenty five cents did in a candy store . 
As my drinking grew heavier , I began to note more and more that it was in the drinking bouts the purple passages occurred . 
At such times things happened . 
Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk . 
The longshoremen all looked forward to their Saturday night drunk . 
In ways , the accidental drunks were the best . 
Stranger and more exciting things happened at such times . 
As , for instance , the Sunday when Nelson and French Frank and Captain Spink stole the stolen salmon boat from Whisky Bob and Nicky the Greek . 
Changes had taken place in the personnel of the oyster boats . 
Nelson had got into a fight with Bill Kelley on the Annie and was carrying a bullet hole through his left hand . 
Such was the tale of his recklessness they spread , that no one on the water front would go out with Nelson . 
So the Reindeer , crewless , lay across the estuary at the sandspit . 
Beside her lay the Razzle Dazzle with a burned mainsail and Scotty and me on board . 
Whisky Bob had fallen out with French Frank and gone on a raid up river with Nicky the Greek . 
The result of this raid was a brand new Columbia River salmon boat , stolen from an Italian fisherman . 
But where was the salmon boat ? Hundreds of Greek and Italian fishermen , up river and down bay , had searched every slough and tule patch for it . 
When the owner despairingly offered a reward of fifty dollars , our interest increased and the mystery deepened . 
One Sunday morning old Captain Spink paid me a visit . 
He had just been fishing in his skiff in the old Alameda ferry slip . 
As the tide went down , he had noticed a rope tied to a pile under water and leading downward . 
In vain he had tried to heave up what was fast on the other end . 
Farther along , to another pile , was a similar rope , leading downward and unheavable . 
Without doubt , it was the missing salmon boat . 
If we restored it to its rightful owner there was fifty dollars in it for us . 
But I had queer ethical notions about honour amongst thieves , and declined to have anything to do with the affair . 
But French Frank had quarrelled with Whisky Bob , and Nelson was also an enemy . 
Within an hour after I had rejected Captain Spink's proposal , I saw him sail down the estuary on board the Reindeer with Nelson . 
Also , French Frank went by on his schooner . 
It was not long ere they sailed back up the estuary , curiously side by side . 
As they headed in for the sandspit , the submerged salmon boat could be seen , gunwales awash and held up from sinking by ropes fast to the schooner and the sloop . 
The tide was half out , and they sailed squarely in on the sand , grounding in a row , with the salmon boat in the middle . 
Immediately Hans , one of French Frank's sailors , was into a skiff and pulling rapidly for the north shore . 
The big demijohn in the stern sheets told his errand . 
They couldn't wait a moment to celebrate the fifty dollars they had so easily earned . 
It is the way of the devotees of John Barleycorn . 
When good fortune comes , they drink . 
When they have no fortune , they drink to the hope of good fortune . 
If fortune be ill , they drink to forget it . 
If they meet a friend , they drink . 
If they quarrel with a friend and lose him , they drink . 
If their love making be crowned with success , they are so happy they needs must drink . 
If they be jilted , they drink for the contrary reason . 
When they are sober they want to drink and when they have drunk they want to drink more . 
Of course , as fellow comrades , Scotty and I were called in for the drinking . 
We helped to make a hole in that fifty dollars not yet received . 
The afternoon , from just an ordinary common summer Sunday afternoon , became a gorgeous , purple afternoon . 
We all talked and sang and ranted and bragged , and ever French Frank and Nelson sent more drinks around . 
We lay in full sight of the Oakland water front , and the noise of our revels attracted friends . 
Skiff after skiff crossed the estuary and hauled up on the sandspit , while Hans' work was cut out for him ever to row back and forth for more supplies of booze . 
Then Whisky Bob and Nicky the Greek arrived , sober , indignant , outraged in that their fellow pirates had raised their plant . 
When Nicky the Greek jumped in with a short handled shovel to Whisky Bob's assistance , short work was made of him by Hans . 
And of course , when the bleeding remnants of Bob and Nicky were sent packing in their skiff , the event must needs be celebrated in further carousal . 
By this time , our visitors being numerous , we were a large crowd compounded of many nationalities and diverse temperaments , all aroused by John Barleycorn , all restraints cast off . 
Old quarrels revived , ancient hates flared up . 
Fight was in the air . 
And every fight was made up in more rounds of drinks , wherein the combatants , aided and abetted by the rest of us , embraced each other and pledged undying friendship . 
And , of all times , Soup Kennedy selected this time to come and retrieve an old shirt of his , left aboard the Reindeer from the trip he sailed with Clam . 
He had espoused Clam's side of the quarrel with Nelson . 
Also , he had been drinking in the St . 
Louis House , so that it was John Barleycorn who led him to the sandspit in quest of his old shirt . 
Few words started the fray . 
And we let them loose on the sand . 
Once , when it looked as if Nelson were getting the worst of it , French Frank and John Barleycorn sprang unfairly into the fight . 
Scotty protested and reached for French Frank , who whirled upon him and fell on top of him in a pummelling clinch after a sprawl of twenty feet across the sand . 
In the course of separating these two , half a dozen fights started amongst the rest of us . 
These fights were finished , one way or the other , or we separated them with drinks , while all the time Nelson and Soup Kennedy fought on . 
Occasionally we returned to them and gave advice , such as , when they lay exhausted in the sand , unable to strike a blow , Throw sand in his eyes . 
And they threw sand in each other's eyes , recuperated , and fought on to successive exhaustions . 
It was life raw and naked , wild and free the only life of that sort which my birth in time and space permitted me to attain . 
And Scotty threw up his job as crew , and departed in the night with a pair of blankets belonging to me . 
During the night , while the oyster pirates lay stupefied in their bunks , the schooner and the Reindeer floated on the high water and swung about to their anchors . 
The salmon boat , still filled with rocks and water , rested on the bottom . 
In the morning , early , I heard wild cries from the Reindeer , and tumbled out in the chill grey to see a spectacle that made the water front laugh for days . 
The beautiful salmon boat lay on the hard sand , squashed flat as a pancake , while on it were perched French Frank's schooner and the Reindeer . 
Unfortunately two of the Reindeer's planks had been crushed in by the stout oak stem of the salmon boat . 
The rising tide had flowed through the hole , and just awakened Nelson by getting into his bunk with him . 
I lent a hand , and we pumped the Reindeer out and repaired the damage . 
Then Nelson cooked breakfast , and while we ate we considered the situation . 
So was I. The fifty dollars reward would never be paid for that pitiful mess of splinters on the sand beneath us . 
He had a wounded hand and no crew . 
I had a burned main sail and no crew . 
What d'ye say , you and me ? Nelson queried . 
I'll go you , was my answer . 
And thus I became partners with Young Scratch Nelson , the wildest , maddest of them all . 
We borrowed the money for an outfit of grub from Johnny Heinhold , filled our water barrels , and sailed away that day for the oyster beds . 
CHAPTER XII Nor have I ever regretted those months of mad devilry I put in with Nelson . 
He COULD sail , even if he did frighten every man that sailed with him . 
To steer to miss destruction by an inch or an instant was his joy . 
To do what everybody else did not dare attempt to do , was his pride . 
Never to reef down was his mania , and in all the time I spent with him , blow high or low , the Reindeer was never reefed . 
Nor was she ever dry . 
We strained her open and sailed her open and sailed her open continually . 
And we abandoned the Oakland water front and went wider afield for our adventures . 
And all this glorious passage in my life was made possible for me by John Barleycorn . 
And this is my complaint against John Barleycorn . 
Here I was , thirsting for the wild life of adventure , and the only way for me to win to it was through John Barleycorn's mediation . 
It was the way of the men who lived the life . 
Did I wish to live the life , I must live it the way they did . 
It was by virtue of drinking that I gained that partnership and comradeship with Nelson . 
Had I drunk only the beer he paid for , or had I declined to drink at all , I should never have been selected by him as a partner . 
He wanted a partner who would meet him on the social side , as well as the work side of life . 
I did not like the taste , so I drank for the sole purpose of getting drunk , of getting hopelessly , helplessly drunk . 
I remember going ashore one night with Nelson . 
In my pocket were one hundred and eighty dollars . 
It was my intention , first , to buy me some clothes , after that , some drinks . 
I had no hat , so I had to wear the sou'wester , and it will be noted that I have listed neither underclothes nor socks . 
To reach the stores where clothes could be bought , we had to pass a dozen saloons . 
So I bought me the drinks first . 
I never got to the clothing stores . 
In the morning , broke , poisoned , but contented , I came back on board , and we set sail . 
I possessed only the clothes I had gone ashore in , and not a cent remained of the one hundred and eighty dollars . 
It might well be deemed impossible , by those who have never tried it , that in twelve hours a lad can spend all of one hundred and eighty dollars for drinks . 
And I had no regrets . 
I had shown them I could spend with the best of them . 
Amongst strong men I had proved myself strong . 
I had clinched again , as I had often clinched , my right to the title of Prince . 
Also , my attitude may be considered , in part , as a reaction from my childhood's meagreness and my childhood's excessive toil . 
Possibly my inchoate thought was Better to reign among booze fighters a prince than to toil twelve hours a day at a machine for ten cents an hour . 
There are no purple passages in machine toil . 
But if the spending of one hundred and eighty dollars in twelve hours isn't a purple passage , then I'd like to know what is . 
Oh , I skip much of the details of my trafficking with John Barleycorn during this period , and shall only mention events that will throw light on John Barleycorn's ways . 
While out on the water , we never carried any drink along . 
The world was opening up to me . 
Already I knew several hundred miles of the water ways of it , and of the towns and cities and fishing hamlets on the shores . 
Came the whisper to range farther . 
I had not found it yet . 
But even this much of the world was too wide for Nelson . 
He wearied for his beloved Oakland water front , and when he elected to return to it we separated in all friendliness . 
I now made the old town of Benicia , on the Carquinez Straits , my headquarters . 
In a cluster of fishermen's arks , moored in the tules on the water front , dwelt a congenial crowd of drinkers and vagabonds , and I joined them . 
I held my own with any one , drink for drink and often drank more than my share to show the strength of my manhood . 
And when I never drew a sober breath , on one stretch , for three solid weeks , I was certain I had reached the top . 
Surely , in that direction , one could go no farther . 
It was time for me to move on . 
For always , drunk or sober , at the back of my consciousness something whispered that this carousing and bay adventuring was not all of life . 
This whisper was my good fortune . 
I happened to be so made that I could hear it calling , always calling , out and away over the world . 
It was not canniness on my part . 
It was curiosity , desire to know , an unrest and a seeking for things wonderful that I seemed somehow to have glimpsed or guessed . 
What was this life for , I demanded , if this were all ? No there was something more , away and beyond . 
But what gave immediacy to my decision to move on was a trick John Barleycorn played me a monstrous , incredible trick that showed abysses of intoxication hitherto undreamed . 
At one o'clock in the morning , after a prodigious drunk , I was tottering aboard a sloop at the end of the wharf , intending to go to sleep . 
The tides sweep through Carquinez Straits as in a mill race , and the full ebb was on when I stumbled overboard . 
There was nobody on the wharf , nobody on the sloop . 
I was borne away by the current . 
I thought the misadventure delightful . 
I was a good swimmer , and in my inflamed condition the contact of the water with my skin soothed me like cool linen . 
And then John Barleycorn played me his maniacal trick . 
Some maundering fancy of going out with the tide suddenly obsessed me . 
I had never been morbid . 
Thoughts of suicide had never entered my head . 
And now that they entered , I thought it fine , a splendid culminating , a perfect rounding off of my short but exciting career . 
This was the trick of John Barleycorn , laying me by the heels of my imagination and in a drug dream dragging me to death . 
Oh , he was convincing . 
I had really experienced all of life , and it didn't amount to much . 
was the last and best , and I could see for myself what it was worth . 
There were all the broken down old bums and loafers I had bought drinks for . 
That was what remained of life . 
Did I want to become like them ? A thousand times no and I wept tears of sweet sadness over my glorious youth going out with the tide . 
It was a man's way to die . 
John Barleycorn changed the tune he played in my drink maddened brain . 
Away with tears and regret . 
It was a hero's death , and by the hero's own hand and will . 
So I struck up my death chant and was singing it lustily , when the gurgle and splash of the current riffles in my ears reminded me of my more immediate situation . 
Below the town of Benicia , where the Solano wharf projects , the Straits widen out into what bay farers call the Bight of Turner's Shipyard . 
I was in the shore tide that swept under the Solano wharf and on into the bight . 
I knew of old the power of the suck which developed when the tide swung around the end of Dead Man's Island and drove straight for the wharf . 
I didn't want to go through those piles . 
It wouldn't be nice , and I might lose an hour in the bight on my way out with the tide . 
I undressed in the water and struck out with a strong , single overhand stroke , crossing the current at right angles . 
Nor did I cease until , by the wharf lights , I knew I was safe to sweep by the end . 
Then I turned over and rested . 
The stroke had been a telling one , and I was a little time in recovering my breath . 
I was elated , for I had succeeded in avoiding the suck . 
I started to raise my death chant again a purely extemporised farrago of a drug crazed youth . 
Don't sing yet , whispered John Barleycorn . 
The Solano runs all night . 
There are railroad men on the wharf . 
They will hear you , and come out in a boat and rescue you , and you don't want to be rescued . 
What ? Be robbed of my hero's death ? Never . 
When I was well clear , in mid channel , I sang again . 
Sometimes I swam a few strokes , but in the main I contented myself with floating and dreaming long drunken dreams . 
Next I discovered that I was very weary and very cold , and quite sober , and that I didn't in the least want to be drowned . 
I could make out the Selby Smelter on the Contra Costa shore and the Mare Island lighthouse . 
I was sober now , and I didn't want to die . 
I discovered scores of reasons for living . 
And the more reasons I discovered , the more liable it seemed that I was going to drown anyway . 
A stiff breeze had sprung up , and the crisp little waves were persistently lapping into my mouth , and I was beginning to swallow salt water . 
With my swimmer's knowledge , I knew the end was near . 
And then the boat came a Greek fisherman running in for Vallejo and again I had been saved from John Barleycorn by my constitution and physical vigour . 
And , in passing , let me note that this maniacal trick John Barleycorn played me is nothing uncommon . 
An absolute statistic of the per centage of suicides due to John Barleycorn would be appalling . 
CHAPTER XIII So I left Benicia , where John Barleycorn had nearly got me , and ranged wider afield in pursuit of the whisper from the back of life to come and find . 
And wherever I ranged , the way lay along alcohol drenched roads . 
Men still congregated in saloons . 
They were the poor man's clubs , and they were the only clubs to which I had access . 
I could get acquainted in saloons . 
I could go into a saloon and talk with any man . 
In the strange towns and cities I wandered through , the only place for me to go was the saloon . 
I was no longer a stranger in any town the moment I had entered a saloon . 
And right here let me break in with experiences no later than last year . 
I harnessed four horses to a light trap , took Charmian along , and drove for three months and a half over the wildest mountain parts of California and Oregon . 
Each morning I did my regular day's work of writing fiction . 
That completed , I drove on through the middle of the day and the afternoon to the next stop . 
But the irregularity of occurrence of stopping places , coupled with widely varying road conditions , made it necessary to plan , the day before , each day's drive and my work . 
I must know when I was to start driving in order to start writing in time to finish my day's output . 
Thus , on occasion , when the drive was to be long , I would be up and at my writing by five in the morning . 
On easier driving days I might not start writing till nine o'clock . 
Well , the first thing , a drink . 
Have something yourself , to the barkeeper . 
And then , as we drink , my opening query about roads and stopping places on ahead . 
Let me see , the barkeeper will say , there's the road across Tarwater Divide . 
That used to be good . 
I was over it three years ago . 
But it was blocked this spring . 
Say , I'll tell you what . 
Say , Jerry , how about the Tarwater road ? You was down to Wilkins last week . 
And while Bill or Jerry or Tom is beginning to unlimber his thinking and speaking apparatus , I suggest that he join us in the drink . 
And thus is demonstrated a service John Barleycorn renders , a service by which he increases his power over men . 
And over the world , wherever I have gone , during all the years , it has been the same . 
But to return to my narrative . 
When I turned my back on Benicia , my way led through saloons . 
I had developed no moral theories against drinking , and I disliked as much as ever the taste of the stuff . 
But I had grown respectfully suspicious of John Barleycorn . 
I could not forget that trick he had played on me on me who did not want to die . 
So I continued to drink , and to keep a sharp eye on John Barleycorn , resolved to resist all future suggestions of self destruction . 
In strange towns I made immediate acquaintances in the saloons . 
When I hoboed , and hadn't the price of a bed , a saloon was the only place that would receive me and give me a chair by the fire . 
I could go into a saloon and wash up , brush my clothes , and comb my hair . 
And saloons were always so damnably convenient . 
They were everywhere in my western country . 
I couldn't go into the dwellings of strangers that way . 
Their doors were not open to me no seats were there for me by their fires . 
Also , churches and preachers I had never known . 
And from what I didn't know I was not attracted toward them . 
Besides , there was no glamour about them , no haze of romance , no promise of adventure . 
They were the sort with whom things never happened . 
They lived and remained always in the one place , creatures of order and system , narrow , limited , restrained . 
They were without greatness , without imagination , without camaraderie . 
And here is another complaint I bring against John Barleycorn . 
It is these good fellows that he gets the fellows with the fire and the go in them , who have bigness , and warmness , and the best of the human weaknesses . 
One doesn't meet these in saloons , nor rallying to lost causes , nor flaming on the adventure paths , nor loving as God's own mad lovers . 
They are too busy keeping their feet dry , conserving their heart beats , and making unlovely life successes of their spirit mediocrity . 
And so I draw the indictment home to John Barleycorn . 
Of course , he ruins weaklings but with them , the worst we breed , I am not here concerned . 
My concern is that it is so much of the best we breed whom John Barleycorn destroys . 
With John Barleycorn out of the way , these daring ones would still be born , and they would do things instead of perishing . 
Always I encountered the camaraderie of drink . 
I might be walking down the track to the water tank to lie in wait for a passing freight train , when I would chance upon a bunch of alki stiffs . 
An alki stiff is a tramp who drinks druggist's alcohol . 
Immediately , with greeting and salutation , I am taken into the fellowship . 
I , too , spent my time on shore with him , only occasionally going for cruises of several days on the bay to help out on short handed scow schooners . 
The result was that I was no longer reinvigorated by periods of open air abstinence and healthy toil . 
I drank every day , and whenever opportunity offered I drank to excess for I still laboured under the misconception that the secret of John Barleycorn lay in drinking to bestiality and unconsciousness . 
I became pretty thoroughly alcohol soaked during this period . 
I practically lived in saloons became a bar room loafer , and worse . 
And right here was John Barleycorn getting me in a more insidious though no less deadly way than when he nearly sent me out with the tide . 
I had never had a real boyhood , and in this , my precocious manhood , I was very hard and woefully wise . 
Though I had never known girl's love even , I had crawled through such depths that I was convinced absolutely that I knew the last word about love and life . 
And it wasn't a pretty knowledge . 
Without being pessimistic , I was quite satisfied that life was a rather cheap and ordinary affair . 
You see , John Barleycorn was blunting me . 
The old stings and prods of the spirit were no longer sharp . 
But the other side of the world was a long way to go for a drink . 
I had but to step to the corner and get all I wanted at Joe Vigy's . 
Johnny Heinhold still ran the Last Chance . 
And there were saloons on all the corners and between the corners . 
The whispers from the back of life were growing dim as my mind and body soddened . 
The old unrest was drowsy . 
I might as well rot and die here in Oakland as anywhere else . 
And I should have so rotted and died , and not in very long order either , at the pace John Barleycorn was leading me , had the matter depended wholly on him . 
I was learning what it was to have no appetite . 
There is no end to John Barleycorn's tricks . 
He had tried to inveigle me into killing myself . 
At this period he was doing his best to kill me at a fairly rapid pace . 
But , not satisfied with that , he tried another dodge . 
He very nearly got me , too , and right there I learned a lesson about him became a wiser , a more skilful drinker . 
I learned there were limits to my gorgeous constitution , and that there were no limits to John Barleycorn . 
Nelson and I were sitting in the Overland House . 
It was early in the evening , and the only reason we were there was because we were broke and it was election time . 
You see , in election time local politicians , aspirants for office , have a way of making the rounds of the saloons to get votes . 
It's going to be a warm evening after all , and you know you'll get a souse started at the very least . 
And who knows ? the gods may be kind , other drinks may come , and the night culminate in glorious greatness . 
And the next thing you know , you are lined up at the bar , pouring drinks down your throat and learning the gentlemen's names and the offices which they hope to fill . 
Yes , I was learning how noble politics and politicians are . 
And there entered Joe Goose he of the unquenchable thirst , the wicked eyes , the crooked nose , the flowered vest . 
Come on , fellows free booze all you want of it . 
I didn't want you to miss it . 
Where ? we wanted to know . 
I'll tell you as we go along . 
We haven't a minute to lose . 
And as we hurried up town , Joe Goose explained It's the Hancock Fire Brigade . 
All you have to do is wear a red shirt and a helmet , and carry a torch . 
They're going down on a special train to Haywards to parade . 
The town'll be wide open , Joe Goose went on . 
Booze ? It'll run like water . 
The politicians have bought the stocks of the saloons . 
All you got to do is walk right up and call for it . 
Oh , those politicians had handled our kind before . 
At Haywards there were no drinks either . 
Parade first , and earn your booze , was the order of the night . 
Then the saloons were opened . 
Extra barkeepers had been engaged , and the drinkers jammed six deep before every drink drenched and unwiped bar . 
There was no time to wipe the bar , nor wash glasses , nor do anything save fill glasses . 
The Oakland water front can be real thirsty on occasion . 
This method of jamming and struggling in front of the bar was too slow for us . 
The politicians had bought it for us . 
We'd paraded and earned it , hadn't we ? So we made a flank attack around the end of the bar , shoved the protesting barkeepers aside , and helped ourselves to bottles . 
Outside , we knocked the necks of the bottles off against the concrete curbs , and drank . 
Now Joe Goose and Nelson had learned discretion with straight whisky , drunk in quantity . 
I still laboured under the misconception that one was to drink all he could get especially when it didn't cost anything . 
We shared our bottles with others , and drank a good portion ourselves , while I drank most of all . 
And I didn't like the stuff . 
I drank it as I had drunk beer at five , and wine at seven . 
I mastered my qualms and downed it like so much medicine . 
And when we wanted more bottles , we went into other saloons where the free drink was flowing , and helped ourselves . 
I haven't the slightest idea of how much I drank whether it was two quarts or five . 
I do know that I began the orgy with half pint draughts and with no water afterward to wash the taste away or to dilute the whisky . 
Now the politicians were too wise to leave the town filled with drunks from the water front of Oakland . 
When train time came , there was a round up of the saloons . 
Already I was feeling the impact of the whisky . 
Nelson and I were hustled out of a saloon , and found ourselves in the very last rank of a disorderly parade . 
I struggled along heroically , my correlations breaking down , my legs tottering under me , my head swimming , my heart pounding , my lungs panting for air . 
My helplessness was coming on so rapidly that my reeling brain told me I would go down and out and never reach the train if I remained at the rear of the procession . 
I left the ranks and ran down a pathway beside the road under broad spreading trees . 
Nelson pursued me , laughing . 
Certain things stand out , as in memories of nightmare . 
I remember those trees especially , and my desperate running along under them , and how , every time I fell , roars of laughter went up from the other drunks . 
They thought I was merely antic drunk . 
They did not dream that John Barleycorn had me by the throat in a death clutch . 
And I remember the fleeting bitterness that was mine as I realised that I was in a struggle with death , and that these others did not know . 
It was as if I were drowning before a crowd of spectators who thought I was cutting up tricks for their entertainment . 
And running there under the trees , I fell and lost consciousness . 
What happened afterward , with one glimmering exception , I had to be told . 
Nelson , with his enormous strength , picked me up and dragged me on and aboard the train . 
When he had got me into a seat , I fought and panted so terribly for air that even with his obtuseness he knew I was in a bad way . 
And right there , at any moment , I know now , I might have died . 
I often think it is the nearest to death I have ever been . 
I have only Nelson's description of my behaviour to go by . 
I was scorching up , burning alive internally , in an agony of fire and suffocation , and I wanted air . 
My efforts to raise a window were vain , for all the windows in the car were screwed down . 
Nelson had seen drink crazed men , and thought I wanted to throw myself out . 
He tried to restrain me , but I fought on . 
I seized some man's torch and smashed the glass . 
Now there were pro Nelson and anti Nelson factions on the Oakland water front , and men of both factions , with more drink in them than was good , filled the car . 
My smashing of the window was the signal for the antis . 
This being knocked cold and motionless was perhaps the best thing that could have happened to me . 
My violent struggles had only accelerated my already dangerously accelerated heart , and increased the need for oxygen in my suffocating lungs . 
After the fight was over and I came to , I did not come to myself . 
I was no more myself than a drowning man is who continues to struggle after he has lost consciousness . 
I have no memory of my actions , but I cried Air ! Air ! so insistently , that it dawned on Nelson that I did not contemplate self destruction . 
So he cleared the jagged glass from the window ledge and let me stick my head and shoulders out . 
He realised , partially , the seriousness of my condition . 
and held me by the waist to prevent me from crawling farther out . 
And for the rest of the run in to Oakland I kept my head and shoulders out , fighting like a maniac whenever he tried to draw me inside . 
And here my one glimmering streak of true consciousness came . 
All the rest is a blank . 
I came to the following evening , in a water front lodging house . 
No doctor had been called in . 
Many a man , as every doctor knows , has died of the sudden impact of a quart or more of whisky . 
Usually one reads of them so dying , strong drinkers , on account of a wager . 
But I didn't know then . 
And so I learned and by no virtue nor prowess , but simply through good fortune and constitution . 
Again my constitution had triumphed over John Barleycorn . 
I had escaped from another death pit , dragged myself through another morass , and perilously acquired the discretion that would enable me to drink wisely for many another year to come . 
And , oh , it wasn't John Barleycorn's fault that he didn't get me that night of the Hancock Fire Brigade . 
CHAPTER XV It was during the early winter of that I resolved to go to sea . 
My Hancock Fire Brigade experience was very little responsible for this . 
I still drank and frequented saloons practically lived in saloons . 
Whisky was dangerous , in my opinion , but not wrong . 
Whisky was dangerous like other dangerous things in the natural world . 
Men died of whisky but then , too , fishermen were capsized and drowned , hoboes fell under trains and were cut to pieces . 
To cope with winds and waves , railroad trains , and bar rooms , one must use judgment . 
To get drunk after the manner of men was all right , but one must do it with discretion . 
No more quarts of whisky for me . 
What really decided me to go to sea was that I had caught my first vision of the death road which John Barleycorn maintains for his devotees . 
It was not a clear vision , however , and there were two phases of it , somewhat jumbled at the time . 
It struck me , from watching those with whom I associated , that the life we were living was more destructive than that lived by the average man . 
John Barleycorn , by inhibiting morality , incited to crime . 
Everywhere I saw men doing , drunk , what they would never dream of doing sober . 
And this wasn't the worst of it . 
It was the penalty that must be paid . 
Saloon mates I drank with , who were good fellows and harmless , sober , did most violent and lunatic things when they were drunk . 
And then the police gathered them in and they vanished from our ken . 
Sometimes I visited them behind the bars and said good bye ere they journeyed across the bay to put on the felon's stripes . 
And time and again I heard the one explanation IF I HADN'T BEEN DRUNK I WOULDN'T A DONE IT . 
And sometimes , under the spell of John Barleycorn , the most frightful things were done things that shocked even my case hardened soul . 
The other phase of the death road was that of the habitual drunkards , who had a way of turning up their toes without apparent provocation . 
When they took sick , even with trifling afflictions that any ordinary man could pull through , they just pegged out . 
So I considered my situation and knew that I was getting into a bad way of living . 
It made toward death too quickly to suit my youth and vitality . 
And there was only one way out of this hazardous manner of living , and that was to get out . 
The sealing fleet was wintering in San Francisco Bay , and in the saloons I met skippers , mates , hunters , boat steerers , and boat pullers . 
I met the seal hunter , Pete Holt , and agreed to be his boat puller and to sign on any schooner he signed on . 
And I had to have half a dozen drinks with Pete Holt there and then to seal our agreement . 
And at once awoke all my old unrest that John Barleycorn had put to sleep . 
I found myself actually bored with the saloon life of the Oakland water front , and wondered what I had ever found fascinating in it . 
I lived more circumspectly , drank less deeply , and went home more frequently . 
When drinking grew too wild , I got out . 
When Nelson was in his maniacal cups , I managed to get separated from him . 
And of course we had to drink on it . 
Joe Vigy cashed my advance note , and Pete Holt treated , and I treated , and Joe Vigy treated , and other hunters treated . 
This isolated group , belonging to Japan , had been selected as the rendezvous of the Canadian and American sealing fleets . 
Here they filled their water barrels and made repairs before starting on the hundred days' harrying of the seal herd along the northern coasts of Japan to Behring Sea . 
Those fifty one days of fine sailing and intense sobriety had put me in splendid fettle . 
The alcohol had been worked out of my system , and from the moment the voyage began I had not known the desire for a drink . 
I doubt if I even thought once about a drink . 
In the forecastle , the oldest man , fat and fifty , was Louis . 
He was a broken skipper . 
John Barleycorn had thrown him , and he was winding up his career where he had begun it , in the forecastle . 
His case made quite an impression on me . 
John Barleycorn did other things beside kill a man . 
He had done much worse . 
The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land . 
Aborigines , in queer outrigger canoes , and Japanese , in queerer sampans , paddled about the bay and came aboard . 
It was my first foreign land I had won to the other side of the world , and I would see all I had read in the books come true . 
I was wild to get ashore . 
Victor and Axel , a Swede and a Norwegian , and I planned to keep together . 
And Axel was keen to go fishing . 
The three of us agreed to that , too . 
We would get a sampan , and a couple of Japanese fishermen who knew the fishing grounds , and we would have great sport . 
As for me , I was keen for anything . 
And then , our plans made , we rowed ashore over the banks of living coral and pulled our boat up the white beach of coral sand . 
Victor and Axel said that we'd have a drink before we started on our long walk . 
Could I decline to drink with these two chesty shipmates ? Drinking together , glass in hand , put the seal on comradeship . 
It was the way of life . 
Our teetotaler owner captain was laughed at , and sneered at , by all of us because of his teetotalism . 
I didn't in the least want a drink , but I did want to be a good fellow and a good comrade . 
Nor did Louis' case deter me , as I poured the biting , scorching stuff down my throat . 
John Barleycorn had thrown Louis to a nasty fall , but I was young . 
My blood ran full and red I had a constitution of iron and well , youth ever grins scornfully at the wreckage of age . 
Queer , fierce , alcoholic stuff it was that we drank . 
There was no telling where or how it had been manufactured some native concoction most likely . 
But it was hot as fire , pale as water , and quick as death with its kick . 
It had been filled into empty square face bottles which had once contained Holland gin , and which still bore the fitting legend Anchor Brand . 
We never got out of the town . 
We never went fishing in the sampan . 
And though we were there ten days , we never trod that wild path along the lava cliffs and among the flowers . 
We met old acquaintances from other schooners , fellows we had met in the saloons of San Francisco before we sailed . 
By mid afternoon Victor went mad with drink , and wanted to fight everybody and everything . 
I have since seen lunatics in the violent wards of asylums that seemed to behave in no wise different from Victor's way , save that perhaps he was more violent . 
But no sooner did Victor's feet touch the deck than he began to clean up the ship . 
He had the strength of several men , and he ran amuck with it . 
I remember especially one man whom he got into the chain boxes but failed to damage through inability to hit him . 
The man dodged and ducked , and Victor broke all the knuckles of both his fists against the huge links of the anchor chain . 
We rescued him , and by the time we got him below , undressed , and into his bunk , we were wrecks ourselves . 
But Axel and I wanted to see more of shore , and away we went , leaving Victor snoring . 
It was curious , the judgment passed on Victor by his shipmates , drinkers themselves . 
They shook their heads disapprovingly and muttered A man like that oughtn't to drink . 
Now Victor was the smartest sailor and best tempered shipmate in the forecastle . 
He was an all round splendid type of seaman his mates recognised his worth , and respected him and liked him . 
Yet John Barleycorn metamorphosed him into a violent lunatic . 
And that was the very point these drinkers made . 
They knew that drink and drink with a sailor is always excessive made them mad , but only mildly mad . 
Violent madness was objectionable because it spoiled the fun of others and often culminated in tragedy . 
From their standpoint , mild madness was all right . 
Ashore , snugly ensconced in a Japanese house of entertainment , Axel and I compared bruises , and over a comfortable drink talked of the afternoon's happenings . 
We liked the quietness of that drink and took another . 
A shipmate dropped in , several shipmates dropped in , and we had more quiet drinks . 
Still howling , disdaining doorways , with blood shot eyes and wildly waving muscular arms , Victor burst upon us through the fragile walls . 
The old amuck rage was on him , and he wanted blood , anybody's blood . 
The orchestra fled so did we . 
We went through doorways , and we went through paper walls anything to get away . 
The main street was a madness . 
Hundreds of sailors rollicked up and down . 
Because the chief of police with his small force was helpless , the governor of the colony had issued orders to the captains to have all their men on board by sunset . 
What ! To be treated in such fashion ! As the news spread among the schooners , they were emptied . 
Men who had had no intention of coming ashore climbed into the boats . 
The unfortunate governor's ukase had precipitated a general debauch for all hands . 
It was hours after sunset , and the men wanted to see anybody try to put them on board . 
They went around inviting the authorities to try to put them on board . 
In front of the governor's house they were gathered thickest , bawling sea songs , circulating square faces , and dancing uproarious Virginia reels and old country dances . 
The police , including the reserves , stood in little forlorn groups , waiting for the command the governor was too wise to issue . 
And I thought this saturnalia was great . 
It was like the old days of the Spanish Main come back . 
It was license it was adventure . 
And I was part of it , a chesty sea rover along with all these other chesty sea rovers among the paper houses of Japan . 
The governor never issued the order to clear the streets , and Axel and I wandered on from drink to drink . 
After a time , in some of the antics , getting hazy myself , I lost him . 
I drifted along , making new acquaintances , downing more drinks , getting hazier and hazier . 
And with due and proper and most intricate Japanese ceremonial we of the circle drank saki , pale , mild , and lukewarm , from tiny porcelain bowls . 
They were healthy , smooth skinned , clear eyed , and they were young youths like me , learning the way of their feet in the world of men . 
No mild saki for them , but square faces illicitly refilled with corrosive fire that flamed through their veins and burst into conflagrations in their heads . 
And one last picture I have , standing out very clear and bright in the midst of vagueness before and blackness afterward . 
We the apprentices and I are swaying and clinging to one another under the stars . 
We are singing a rollicking sea song , all save one who sits on the ground and weeps and we are marking the rhythm with waving square faces . 
From up and down the street come far choruses of sea voices similarly singing , and life is great , and beautiful and romantic , and magnificently mad . 
And next , after the blackness , I open my eyes in the early dawn to see a Japanese woman , solicitously anxious , bending over me . 
She is the port pilot's wife and I am lying in her doorway . 
I am chilled and shivering , sick with the after sickness of debauch . 
And I feel lightly clad . 
Those rascals of runaway apprentices ! They have acquired the habit of running away . 
They have run away with my possessions . 
My few dollars are gone . 
And yes , my shoes . 
And the foregoing is a sample of the ten days I spent in the Bonin Islands . 
Victor got over his lunacy , rejoined Axel and me , and after that we caroused somewhat more discreetly . 
And we never climbed that lava path among the flowers . 
The town and the square faces were all we saw . 
One who has been burned by fire must preach about the fire . 
I might have seen and healthily enjoyed a whole lot more of the Bonin Islands , if I had done what I ought to have done . 
But , as I see it , it is not a matter of what one ought to do , or ought not to do . 
It is what one DOES do . 
That is the everlasting , irrefragable fact . 
I did just what I did . 
I did what all those men did in the Bonin Islands . 
I did what millions of men over the world were doing at that particular point in time . 
I did it because the way led to it , because I was only a human boy , a creature of my environment , and neither an anaemic nor a god . 
And the way was open . 
It was like an uncovered well in a yard where children play . 
It is small use to tell the brave little boys toddling their way along into knowledge of life that they mustn't play near the uncovered well . 
And we know that a certain percentage of them , the livest and most daring , will fall into the well . 
The thing to do we all know it is to cover up the well . 
The case is the same with John Barleycorn . 
It was wild and heavy work , without a drink or thought of drink . 
Then we sailed south to Yokohama , with a big catch of skins in our salt and a heavy pay day coming . 
I was eager to be ashore and see Japan , but the first day was devoted to ship's work , and not until evening did we sailors land . 
And here , by the very system of things , by the way life was organised and men transacted affairs , John Barleycorn reached out and tucked my arm in his . 
The captain had given money for us to the hunters , and the hunters were waiting in a certain Japanese public house for us to come and get it . 
We rode to the place in rickshaws . 
Our own crowd had taken possession of it . 
Everybody had money , and everybody was treating . 
And after that we would see the town . 
It was the old story . 
We lay in Yokohama harbour for two weeks , and about all we saw of Japan was its drinking places where sailors congregated . 
Occasionally , some one of us varied the monotony with a more exciting drunk . 
Perhaps it was for things like that , I imagined , that men got drunk . 
In our little round of living what I had done was a noteworthy event . 
All the harbour talked about it . 
I enjoyed several days of fame among the Japanese boatmen and ashore in the pubs . 
It was a red letter event . 
It was an event to be remembered and narrated with pride . 
I remember it to day , twenty years afterward , with a secret glow of pride . 
It was a purple passage , just as Victor's wrecking of the tea house in the Bonin Islands and my being looted by the runaway apprentices were purple passages . 
The point is that the charm of John Barleycorn was still a mystery to me . 
I was so organically a non alcoholic that alcohol itself made no appeal the chemical reactions it produced in me were not satisfying because I possessed no need for such chemical satisfaction . 
And I still had a sweet tooth , and on privy occasions when there was no man to see , bought candy and blissfully devoured it . 
We hove up anchor to a jolly chanty , and sailed out of Yokohama harbour for San Francisco . 
We took the northern passage , and with the stout west wind at our back made the run across the Pacific in thirty seven days of brave sailing . 
The first statement of each man ever an ancient one in homeward bound forecastles was No boarding house sharks in mine . 
Next , in parentheses , was regret at having spent so much money in Yokohama . 
And after that , each man proceeded to paint his favourite phantom . 
Victor , for instance , said that immediately he landed in San Francisco he would pass right through the water front and the Barbary Coast , and put an advertisement in the papers . 
His advertisement would be for board and room in some simple working class family . 
Then , said Victor , I shall go to some dancing school for a week or two , just to meet and get acquainted with the girls and fellows . 
No he wasn't going to drink . 
He knew the way of it , particularly his way of it , wine in , wit out , and his money would be gone in no time . 
Said Axel Gunderson , who didn't care for dancing and social functions I've got a good pay day . 
Now I can go home . 
It is fifteen years since I've seen my mother and all the family . 
When I pay off , I shall send my money home to wait for me . 
Then I'll pick a good ship bound for Europe , and arrive there with another pay day . 
Put them together , and I'll have more money than ever in my life before . 
I'll be a prince at home . 
You haven't any idea how cheap everything is in Norway . 
The very thing I'm going to do , declared Red John . 
It's three years since I've received a line from home and ten years since I was there . 
Things are just as cheap in Sweden , Axel , as in Norway , and my folks are real country folk and farmers . 
I'll send my pay day home and ship on the same ship with you for around the Horn . 
We'll pick a good one . 
And for the rest of the voyage they could hardly be pried apart , so infatuated did they become with discussing their plans . 
Long John was not a home body . 
But he was tired of the forecastle . 
No boarding house sharks in his . 
He , too , would get a room in a quiet family , and he would go to a navigation school and study to be a captain . 
Each man swore that for once he would be sensible and not squander his money . 
No boarding house sharks , no sailor town , no drink , was the slogan of our forecastle . 
Never was there such economy . 
They refused to buy anything more from the slopchest . 
Old rags had to last , and they sewed patch upon patch , turning out what are called homeward bound patches of the most amazing proportions . 
They saved on matches , even , waiting till two or three were ready to light their pipes from the same match . 
As we sailed up the San Francisco water front , the moment the port doctors passed us , the boarding house runners were alongside in whitehall boats . 
They swarmed on board , each drumming for his own boarding house , and each with a bottle of free whisky inside his shirt . 
But we waved them grandly and blasphemously away . 
We wanted none of their boarding houses and none of their whisky . 
We were sober , thrifty sailormen , with better use for our money . 
Came the paying off before the shipping commissioner . 
We emerged upon the sidewalk , each with a pocketful of money . 
About us , like buzzards , clustered the sharks and harpies . 
And we looked at each other . 
We had been seven months together , and our paths were separating . 
One last farewell rite of comradeship remained . 
Come on , boys , said our sailing master . 
There stood the inevitable adjacent saloon . 
There were a dozen saloons all around . 
And when we had followed the sailing master into the one of his choice , the sharks were thick on the sidewalk outside . 
Some of them even ventured inside , but we would have nothing to do with them . 
There we stood at the long bar the sailing master , the mate , the six hunters , the six boat steerers , and the five boat pullers . 
There were nineteen of us , and it was to be our last drink together . 
With seven months of men's work in the world , blow high , blow low , behind us , we were looking on each other for the last time . 
We knew it , for sailors' ways go wide . 
And the nineteen of us , drank the sailing master's treat . 
Then the mate looked at us with eloquent eyes and called another round . 
We liked the mate just as well as the sailing master , and we liked them both . 
The time passed , the drinks continued to come on the bar , our voices rose , and the maggots began to crawl . 
There were six hunters , and each insisted , in the sacred name of comradeship , that all hands drink with him just once . 
There were six boat steerers and five boat pullers and the same logic held with them . 
There was money in all our pockets , and our money was as good as any man's , and our hearts were as free and generous . 
What more would John Barleycorn ask in order to have his will with men ? They were ripe to forget their dearly cherished plans . 
They rolled out of the saloon and into the arms of the sharks and harpies . 
From two days to a week saw the end of their money and saw them being carted by the boarding house masters on board outward bound ships . 
Victor was a fine body of a man , and through a lucky friendship managed to get into the life saving service . 
He never saw the dancing school nor placed his advertisement for a room in a working class family . 
Nor did Long John win to navigation school . 
By the end of the week he was a transient lumper on a river steamboat . 
Red John and Axel did not send their pay days home to the old country . 
What saved me was that I had a home and people to go to . 
I crossed the bay to Oakland , and , among other things , took a look at the death road . 
Nelson was gone shot to death while drunk and resisting the officers . 
His partner in that affair was lying in prison . 
Old Cole , Old Smoudge , and Bob Smith were gone . 
Another Smith , he of the belted guns and the Annie , was drowned . 
French Frank , they said , was lurking up river , afraid to come down because of something he had done . 
Others were wearing the stripes in San Quentin or Folsom . 
Fitzsimmons , with whom I had sailed on the Fish Patrol , had been stabbed in the lung through the back and had died a lingering death complicated with tuberculosis . 
CHAPTER XVIII My infatuation for the Oakland water front was quite dead . 
I didn't like the looks of it , nor the life . 
I didn't care for the drinking , nor the vagrancy of it , and I wandered back to the Oakland Free Library and read the books with greater understanding . 
Then , too , my mother said I had sown my wild oats and it was time I settled down to a regular job . 
Also , the family needed the money . 
So I got a job at the jute mills a ten hour day at ten cents an hour . 
Despite my increase in strength and general efficiency , I was receiving no more than when I worked in the cannery several years before . 
But , then , there was a promise of a rise to a dollar and a quarter a day after a few months . 
And here , so far as John Barleycorn is concerned , began a period of innocence . 
I did not know what it was to take a drink from month end to month end . 
Not yet eighteen years old , healthy and with labour hardened but unhurt muscles , like any young animal I needed diversion , excitement , something beyond the books and the mechanical toil . 
I strayed into Young Men's Christian Associations . 
The life there was healthful and athletic , but too juvenile . 
For me it was too late . 
I was not boy , nor youth , despite my paucity of years . 
I had bucked big with men . 
I knew mysterious and violent things . 
At any rate , the Y. M. C. A. young men were too juvenile for me , too unsophisticated . 
This I would not have minded , could they have met me and helped me mentally . 
But I had got more out of the books than they . 
Their meagre physical experiences , plus their meagre intellectual experiences , made a negative sum so vast that it overbalanced their wholesome morality and healthful sports . 
In short , I couldn't play with the pupils of a lower grade . 
All the clean splendid young life that was theirs was denied me thanks to my earlier tutelage under John Barleycorn . 
I knew too much too young . 
In the meantime , we live to day , here and now , and we discuss to day , here and now . 
I was working ten hours a day in the jute mills . 
It was hum drum machine toil . 
I wanted to realise myself in other ways than at a machine for ten cents an hour . 
And yet I had had my fill of saloons . 
I was developing unguessed and troubling potencies and proclivities . 
And at this very stage , fortunately , I met Louis Shattuck and we became chums . 
Louis Shattuck , without one vicious trait , was a real innocently devilish young fellow , who was quite convinced that he was a sophisticated town boy . 
And I wasn't a town boy at all . 
Louis was handsome , and graceful , and filled with love for the girls . 
With him it was an exciting and all absorbing pursuit . 
I didn't know anything about girls . 
I had been too busy being a man . 
This was an entirely new phase of existence which had escaped me . 
I , too , wanted to play this game . 
Well , there's only one thing to do , said Louis , and that is , you must get a girl . 
Which is more difficult than it sounds . 
Let me show you , at the expense of a slight going aside . 
Louis did not know girls in their home life . 
He had the entree to no girl's home . 
And of course , I , a stranger in this new world , was similarly circumstanced . 
But , further , Louis and I were unable to go to dancing schools , or to public dances , which were very good places for getting acquainted . 
We didn't have the money . 
He was a blacksmith's apprentice , and was earning but slightly more than I. We both lived at home and paid our way . 
I did not mind this money meagreness . 
The disdain I had learned for money from the oyster pirates had never left me . 
But how to get a girl ? There was no girl's home to which Louis could take me and where I might be introduced to girls . 
And Louis' several girls he wanted for himself and anyway , in the very human nature of boys' and girls' ways , he couldn't turn any of them over to me . 
He did persuade them to bring girl friends for me but I found them weak sisters , pale and ineffectual alongside the choice specimens he had . 
You'll have to do like I did , he said finally . 
I got these by getting them . 
You'll have to get one the same way . 
It must be remembered that Louis and I were hard situated . 
We really had to struggle to pay our board and maintain a decent appearance . 
We met each other in the evening , after the day's work , on the street corner , or in a little candy store on a side street , our sole frequenting place . 
Here we bought our cigarettes , and , occasionally , a nickel's worth of red hots . 
In quite primitive fashion , as Louis advised me , I was to select her and make myself acquainted with her . 
We strolled the streets in the early evenings . 
The girls , like us , strolled in pairs . 
And strolling girls will look at strolling boys who look . 
The trouble was that in this Arcadian phase of my history , I , who had come through , case hardened , from the other side of life , was timid and bashful . 
Again and again Louis nerved me up . 
But I didn't know girls . 
They were strange and wonderful to me after my precocious man's life . 
I failed of the bold front and the necessary forwardness when the crucial moment came . 
But when we paired off to stroll along boy and girl together , I noted that Louis had invariably picked the good looker and left to me the little lame sister . 
But girl's love did not immediately come to me . 
I was excited , interested , and I pursued the quest . 
And the thought of drink never entered my mind . 
Some of Louis' and my adventures have since given me serious pause when casting sociological generalisations . 
And before long I learned girl's love , all the dear fond deliciousness of it , all the glory and the wonder . 
I shall call her Haydee . 
She was between fifteen and sixteen . 
Her little skirt reached her shoe tops . 
We sat side by side in a Salvation Army meeting . 
And Louis sat beside me and observed I do believe he did no more than observe , because Haydee was not his style of girl . 
She had a slender oval face . 
Her brown eyes were beautiful . 
Her nose was a dream , as was her sweet lipped , petulant hinting mouth . 
She wore a tam o' shanter , and I thought her brown hair the prettiest shade of brown I had ever seen . 
And from that single experience of half an hour I have ever since been convinced of the reality of love at first sight . 
All too soon the aunt and Haydee departed . 
I was no longer interested in the meeting , and , after an appropriate interval of a couple of minutes or less , started to leave with Louis . 
As we passed out , at the back of the hall a woman recognised me with her eyes , arose , and followed me . 
I shall not describe her . 
She was of my own kind and friendship of the old time on the water front . 
When Nelson was shot , he had died in her arms , and she knew me as his one comrade . 
And when I had heard the tale , I hurried away to find Louis , fearing that I had lost my first love with the first glimpse of her . 
He knew where she lived . 
Each day she passed the blacksmith's shop where he worked , going to or from the Lafayette School . 
The thing to do was to go around to the candy store and see if we could get Nita to give a note to Ruth to give to Haydee . 
If this could be arranged , all I had to do was write the note . 
And in stolen half hours of meeting I came to know all the sweet madness of boy's love and girl's love . 
So far as it goes it is not the biggest love in the world , but I do dare to assert that it is the sweetest . 
Oh , as I look back on it ! Never did girl have more innocent boy lover than I who had been so wicked wise and violent beyond my years . 
I didn't know the first thing about girls . 
I remember we sat on a bench in the starlight . 
There was fully a foot of space between us . 
We slightly faced each other , our near elbows on the back of the bench and once or twice our elbows just touched . 
She had known boys all her life . 
She encouraged me in the ways a girl may . 
I was like to swoon with delight . 
It was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me . 
And I remember yet the faint scent that clung to those gloves and that I breathed in the moment they touched my lips . 
Then came the agony of apprehension and doubt . 
I merely continued to sit there and love with all my soul . 
And when we parted that evening I had not kissed her . 
I do remember the first time I kissed her , on another evening , at parting a mighty moment , when I took all my heart of courage and dared . 
We never succeeded in managing more than a dozen stolen meetings , and we kissed perhaps a dozen times as boys and girls kiss , briefly and innocently , and wonderingly . 
We never went anywhere not even to a matinee . 
We once shared together five cents worth of red hots . 
But I have always fondly believed that she loved me . 
I know I loved her and I dreamed day dreams of her for a year and more , and the memory of her is very dear . 
CHAPTER XIX When I was with people who did not drink , I never thought of drinking . 
Neither he nor I could afford it but , more significant than that , we had no desire to drink . 
We were healthy , normal , non alcoholic . 
Had we been alcoholic , we would have drunk whether or not we could have afforded it . 
Each night , after the day's work , washed up , clothes changed , and supper eaten , we met on the street corner or in the little candy store . 
But the warm fall weather passed , and on bitter nights of frost or damp nights of drizzle , the street corner was not a comfortable meeting place . 
And the candy store was unheated . 
Nita , or whoever waited on the counter , between waitings lurked in a back living room that was heated . 
We were not admitted to this room , and in the store it was as cold as out of doors . 
Louis and I debated the situation . 
There was only one solution the saloon , the congregating place of men , the place where men hobnobbed with John Barleycorn . 
Well do I remember the damp and draughty evening , shivering without overcoats because we could not afford them , that Louis and I started out to select our saloon . 
Saloons are always warm and comfortable . 
Now Louis and I did not go into this saloon because we wanted a drink . 
Yet we knew that saloons were not charitable institutions . 
A man could not make a lounging place of a saloon without occasionally buying something over the bar . 
Our dimes and nickels were few . 
We could ill spare any of them when they were so potent in paying car fare for oneself and a girl . 
So , in this saloon , we desired to make the most of our expenditure . 
Prodigal ! How we grudged it ! We studied the men who came into the place . 
We voted against that saloon , and went out cast down with the knowledge that we had lost an evening and wasted twenty cents for beer that we didn't want . 
We made several more tries on succeeding nights , and at last found our way into the National , a saloon on Tenth and Franklin . 
Here was a more congenial crowd . 
Here Louis met a fellow or two he knew , and here I met fellows I had gone to school with when a little lad in knee pants . 
We talked of old days , and of what had become of this fellow , and what that fellow was doing now , and of course we talked it over drinks . 
They treated , and we drank . 
Then , according to the code of drinking , we had to treat . 
It hurt , for it meant forty to fifty cents a clatter . 
We felt quite enlivened when the short evening was over but at the same time we were bankrupt . 
Our week's spending money was gone . 
We decided that that was the saloon for us , and we agreed to be more circumspect thereafter in our drink buying . 
Also , we had to economise for the rest of the week . 
We didn't even have car fare . 
We were compelled to break an engagement with two girls from West Oakland with whom we were attempting to be in love . 
They were to meet us up town the next evening , and we hadn't the car fare necessary to take them home . 
Like many others financially embarrassed , we had to disappear for a time from the gay whirl at least until Saturday night pay day . 
So Louis and I rendezvoused in a livery stable , and with coats buttoned and chattering teeth played euchre and casino until the time of our exile was over . 
Then we returned to the National Saloon and spent no more than we could decently avoid spending for the comfort and warmth . 
Sometimes we had mishaps , as when one got stuck twice in succession in a five handed game of Sancho Pedro for the drinks . 
Such a disaster meant anywhere between twenty five to eighty cents , just according to how many of the players ordered ten cent drinks . 
But we could temporarily escape the evil effects of such disaster , by virtue of an account we ran behind the bar . 
Of course , this only set back the day of reckoning and seduced us into spending more than we would have spent on a cash basis . 
Louis and I were two healthy youths . 
We didn't want to drink . 
We couldn't afford to drink . 
And yet we were driven by the circumstance of cold and rainy weather to seek refuge in a saloon , where we had to spend part of our pitiful dole for drink . 
It will be urged by some critics that we might have gone to the Y. M. C. A. , to night school , and to the social circles and homes of young people . 
The only reply is that we didn't . 
That is the irrefragable fact . 
I was still resolved to settle down , and I looked about me . 
I must learn a trade , and I decided on electricity . 
The need for electricians was constantly growing . 
But how to become an electrician ? I hadn't the money to go to a technical school or university besides , I didn't think much of schools . 
I was a practical man in a practical world . 
Also , I still believed in the old myths which were the heritage of the American boy when I was a boy . 
A canal boy could become a President . 
After that the senior partnership was only a matter of time . 
Very often so ran the myth the boy , by reason of his steadiness and application , married his employ's daughter . 
By this time I had been encouraged to such faith in myself in the matter of girls that I was quite certain I would marry my employer's daughter . 
There wasn't a doubt of it . 
All the little boys in the myths did it as soon as they were old enough . 
So I bade farewell for ever to the adventure path , and went out to the power plant of one of our Oakland street railways . 
I saw the superintendent himself , in a private office so fine that it almost stunned me . 
But I talked straight up . 
I told him that I wanted to begin right at the bottom and work up , that I wanted to devote my life to this one occupation and this one employment . 
The superintendent beamed as he listened . 
He told me that I was the right stuff for success , and that he believed in encouraging American youth that wanted to rise . 
Why , employers were always on the lookout for young fellows like me , and alas , they found them all too rarely . 
My ambition was fine and worthy , and he would see to it that I got my chance . 
But , he said , as you yourself so plainly see , you couldn't expect to begin as a helper to the car house electricians . 
That will come when you have worked up to it . 
You will really begin at the bottom . 
In the car house your first employment will be sweeping up , washing the windows , keeping things clean . 
And after you have shown yourself satisfactory at that , then you may become a helper to the car house electricians . 
When shall I come to work ? I asked , eager to launch on this dazzling career . 
But , said the superintendent , as you and I have already agreed , you must begin at the bottom . 
Not immediately can you in any capacity enter the car house . 
Before that you must pass through the engine room as an oiler . 
My heart went down slightly and for the moment as I saw the road lengthen between his daughter and me then it rose again . 
I would be a better electrician with knowledge of steam engines . 
As an oiler in the great engine room I was confident that few things concerning steam would escape me . 
Heavens ! My career shone more dazzling than ever . 
When shall I come to work ? I asked gratefully . 
But , said the superintendent , you could not expect to enter immediately into the engine room . 
There must be preparation for that . 
And through the fire room , of course . 
Come , you see the matter clearly , I know . 
And you will see that even the mere handling of coal is a scientific matter and not to be sneered at . 
Now , are you prepared to begin ? Any time , I said valiantly . 
Very well , he answered . 
You will come to morrow morning at seven o'clock . 
I was taken out and shown my duties . 
Years before , at the cannery , I had earned a dollar a day for a ten hour day . 
I consoled myself with the thought that the reason my earning capacity had not increased with my years and strength was because I had remained an unskilled labourer . 
But it was different now . 
I was beginning to work for skill , for a trade , for career and fortune , and the superintendent's daughter . 
And I was beginning in the right way right at the beginning . 
Work ! I , who had worked with men , found that I didn't know the first thing about real work . 
I was working a twelve to thirteen hour day , and I wasn't being paid overtime as in the cannery . 
I might as well give the secret away right here . 
I was doing the work of two men . 
Before me , one mature able bodied labourer had done the day shift and another equally mature able bodied labourer had done the night shift . 
They had received forty dollars a month each . 
The superintendent , bent on an economical administration , had persuaded me to do the work of both men for thirty dollars a month . 
I thought he was making an electrician of me . 
In truth and fact , he was saving fifty dollars a month operating expenses to the company . 
But I didn't know I was displacing two men . 
On the contrary , the superintendent warned everybody not to tell me . 
How valiantly I went at it that first day . 
Work ! I did more than the two men whom I had displaced . 
They had merely wheeled in the coal and dumped it on the plates . 
But while I did this for the day coal , the night coal I had to pile against the wall of the fire room . 
Now the fire room was small . 
It had been planned for a night coal passer . 
So I had to pile the night coal higher and higher , buttressing up the heap with stout planks . 
Toward the top of the heap I had to handle the coal a second time , tossing it up with a shovel . 
I dripped with sweat , but I never ceased from my stride , though I could feel exhaustion coming on . 
This I devoured , standing , grimed with coal dust , my knees trembling under me . 
By eleven o'clock , in this fashion I had consumed my whole lunch . 
But what of it ? I realised that it would enable me to continue working through the noon hour . 
And I worked all the afternoon . 
Darkness came on , and I worked under the electric lights . 
The day fireman went off and the night fireman came on . 
At half past eight , famished , tottering , I washed up , changed my clothes , and dragged my weary body to the car . 
As I sank into a corner outside seat I prayed that no passenger might require my seat . 
But the car filled up , and , half way in , a woman came on board , and there was no seat for her . 
I started to get up , and to my astonishment found that I could not . 
With the chill wind blowing on me , my spent body had stiffened into the seat . 
It took me the rest of the run in to unkink my complaining joints and muscles and get into a standing position on the lower step . 
And when the car stopped at my corner I nearly fell to the ground when I stepped off . 
I hobbled two blocks to the house and limped into the kitchen . 
While my mother started to cook , I plunged into bread and butter but before my appetite was appeased , or the steak fried , I was sound asleep . 
In vain my mother strove to shake me awake enough to eat the meat . 
Failing in this , with the assistance of my father she managed to get me to my room , where I collapsed dead asleep on the bed . 
They undressed me and covered me up . 
In the morning came the agony of being awakened . 
I was terribly sore , and , worst of all , my wrists were swelling . 
Work ! Let any youth just turned eighteen try to out shovel two man grown coal shovellers . 
Work ! Long before midday I had eaten the last scrap of my huge lunch . 
But I was resolved to show them what a husky young fellow determined to rise could do . 
The worst of it was that my wrists were swelling and going back on me . 
There are few who do not know the pain of walking on a sprained ankle . 
Then imagine the pain of shovelling coal and trundling a loaded wheelbarrow with two sprained wrists . 
Work ! More than once I sank down on the coal where no one could see me , and cried with rage , and mortification , and exhaustion , and despair . 
So tightly were they buckled that they were like slightly flexible plaster casts . 
They took the stresses and pressures which hitherto had been borne by my wrists , and they were so tight that there was no room for the inflammation to rise in the sprains . 
And in this fashion I continued to learn to be an electrician . 
Night after night I limped home , fell asleep before I could eat my supper , and was helped into bed and undressed . 
Morning after morning , always with huger lunches in my dinner pail , I limped out of the house on my way to work . 
I no longer read my library books . 
I made no dates with the girls . 
I was a proper work beast . 
I worked , and ate , and slept , while my mind slept all the time . 
The whole thing was a nightmare . 
The strangest part of this experience was that I never took a drink nor thought of taking a drink . 
Yet I knew that men under hard pressure almost invariably drank . 
I had seen them do it , and in the past had often done it myself . 
But so sheerly non alcoholic was I that it never entered my mind that a drink might be good for me . 
I instance this to show how entirely lacking from my make up was any predisposition toward alcohol . 
And the point of this instance is that later on , after more years had passed , contact with John Barleycorn at last did induce in me the alcoholic desire . 
I had often noticed the day fireman staring at me in a curious way . 
At last , one day , he spoke . 
He began by swearing me to secrecy . 
He had been warned by the superintendent not to tell me , and in telling me he was risking his job . 
He told me of the day coal passer and the night coal passer , and of the wages they had received . 
I was doing for thirty dollars a month what they had received eighty dollars for doing . 
He would have told me sooner , the fireman said , had he not been so certain that I would break down under the work and quit . 
As it was , I was killing myself , and all to no good purpose . 
I was merely cheapening the price of labour , he argued , and keeping two men out of a job . 
Being an American boy , and a proud American boy , I did not immediately quit . 
This was foolish of me , I know but I resolved to continue the work long enough to prove to the superintendent that I could do it without breaking down . 
Then I would quit , and he would realise what a fine young fellow he had lost . 
All of which I faithfully and foolishly did . 
I worked on until the time came when I got in the last of the night coal by six o'clock . 
Then I quit the job of learning electricity by doing more than two men's work for a boy's wages , went home , and proceeded to sleep the clock around . 
Fortunately , I had not stayed by the job long enough to injure myself though I was compelled to wear straps on my wrists for a year afterward . 
But the effect of this work orgy in which I had indulged was to sicken me with work . 
The thought of work was repulsive . 
I didn't care if I never settled down . 
Learning a trade could go hang . 
It was a whole lot better to royster and frolic over the world in the way I had previously done . 
So I headed out on the adventure path again , starting to tramp East by beating my way on the railroads . 
CHAPTER XXI But behold ! As soon as I went out on the adventure path I met John Barleycorn again . 
I moved through a world of strangers , and the act of drinking together made one acquainted with men and opened the way to adventures . 
Always it was John Barleycorn . 
Even a tramp , in those halcyon days , could get most frequently drunk . 
I had no call for alcohol , but when I was with those who drank , I drank with them . 
I insisted on travelling or loafing with the livest , keenest men , and it was just these live , keen ones that did most of the drinking . 
They were the more comradely men , the more venturous , the more individual . 
Perhaps it was too much temperament that made them turn from the commonplace and humdrum to find relief in the lying and fantastic sureties of John Barleycorn . 
Be that as it may , the men I liked best , desired most to be with , were invariably to be found in John Barleycorn's company . 
In the course of my tramping over the United States I achieved a new concept . 
As a tramp , I was behind the scenes of society aye , and down in the cellar . 
I could watch the machinery work . 
The men without trades were helpless cattle . 
If one learned a trade , he was compelled to belong to a union in order to work at his trade . 
And his union was compelled to bully and slug the employers' unions in order to hold up wages or hold down hours . 
The employers' unions like wise bullied and slugged . 
I couldn't see any dignity at all . 
And when a workman got old , or had an accident , he was thrown into the scrap heap like any worn out machine . 
I saw too many of this sort who were making anything but dignified ends of life . 
So my new concept was that manual labour was undignified , and that it didn't pay . 
No trade for me , was my decision , and no superintendent's daughters . 
And no criminality , I also decided . 
That would be almost as disastrous as to be a labourer . 
Brains paid , not brawn , and I resolved never again to offer my muscles for sale in the brawn market . 
Brain , and brain only , would I sell . 
I returned to California with the firm intention of developing my brain . 
I had gone through the grammar school long ago , so I entered the Oakland High School . 
To pay my way I worked as a janitor . 
My sister helped me , too and I was not above mowing anybody's lawn or taking up and beating carpets when I had half a day to spare . 
I was working to get away from work , and I buckled down to it with a grim realisation of the paradox . 
Boy and girl love was left behind , and , along with it , Haydee and Louis Shattuck , and the early evening strolls . 
I joined the Henry Clay Debating Society . 
I was received into the homes of some of the members , where I met nice girls whose skirts reached the ground . 
I dallied with little home clubs wherein we discussed poetry and art and the nuances of grammar . 
I joined the socialist local where we studied and orated political economy , philosophy , and politics . 
I kept half a dozen membership cards working in the free library and did an immense amount of collateral reading . 
And for a year and a half on end I never took a drink , nor thought of taking a drink . 
I hadn't the time , and I certainly did not have the inclination . 
Between my janitor work , my studies , and innocent amusements such as chess , I hadn't a moment to spare . 
I was discovering a new world , and such was the passion of my exploration that the old world of John Barleycorn held no inducements for me . 
Come to think of it , I did enter a saloon . 
I went to see Johnny Heinhold in the Last Chance , and I went to borrow money . 
And right here is another phase of John Barleycorn . 
Saloon keepers are notoriously good fellows . 
On an average they perform vastly greater generosities than do business men . 
When I simply had to have ten dollars , desperate , with no place to turn , I went to Johnny Heinhold . 
Several years had passed since I had been in his place or spent a cent across his bar . 
And when I went to borrow the ten dollars I didn't buy a drink , either . 
And Johnny Heinhold let me have the ten dollars without security or interest . 
More than once , in the brief days of my struggle for an education , I went to Johnny Heinhold to borrow money . 
When I entered the university , I borrowed forty dollars from him , without interest , without security , without buying a drink . 
Not that Johnny Heinhold asked me to do it , or expected me to do it . 
I did it , as I have said , in obedience to the code I had learned along with all the other things connected with John Barleycorn . 
When the man so helped has money again , depend upon it that a portion will be spent across the bar of the saloon keeper who befriended him . 
There were two places at which I could borrow money a barber shop and a saloon . 
The barber charged me five per cent . 
That is to say , when I borrowed one hundred dollars , he handed me ninety five . 
The other five dollars he retained as advance interest for the first month . 
And on the second month I paid him five dollars more , and continued so to do each month until I made a ten strike with the editors and lifted the loan . 
The other place to which I came in trouble was the saloon . 
This saloon keeper I had known by sight for a couple of years . 
I had never spent my money in his saloon , and even when I borrowed from him I didn't spend any money . 
Yet never did he refuse me any sum I asked of him . 
Unfortunately , before I became prosperous , he moved away to another city . 
And to this day I regret that he is gone . 
It is the code I have learned . 
This is not to exalt saloon keepers . 
But to return to the run of my narrative . 
Away from the adventure path , up to my ears in study , every moment occupied , I lived oblivious to John Barleycorn's existence . 
If any had drunk , and had they offered it to me , I surely would have drunk . 
I had come back from the other side of life to be delighted with this Arcadian simplicity of student youths and student maidens . 
Also , I had found my way into the realm of the mind , and I was intellectually intoxicated . 
CHAPTER XXII Three years was the time required to go through the high school . 
Also , my schooling was becoming financially impossible . 
At such rate I could not last out , and I did greatly want to go to the state university . 
When I had done a year of high school , I decided to attempt a short cut . 
I borrowed the money and paid to enter the senior class of a cramming joint or academy . 
I was scheduled to graduate right into the university at the end of four months , thus saving two years . 
And how I did cram ! I had two years' new work to do in a third of a year . 
For five weeks I crammed , until simultaneous quadratic equations and chemical formulas fairly oozed from my ears . 
And then the master of the academy took me aside . 
He was very sorry , but he was compelled to give me back my tuition fee and to ask me to leave the school . 
It wasn't a matter of scholarship . 
I stood well in my classes , and did he graduate me into the university he was confident that in that institution I would continue to stand well . 
The trouble was that tongues were gossiping about my case . 
What ! In four months accomplished two years' work ! It would be a scandal , and the universities were becoming severer in their treatment of accredited prep schools . 
He couldn't afford such a scandal , therefore I must gracefully depart . 
And I paid back the borrowed money , and gritted my teeth , and started to cram by myself . 
There were three months yet before the university entrance examinations . 
Without laboratories , without coaching , sitting in my bedroom , I proceeded to compress that two years' work into three months and to keep reviewed on the previous year's work . 
Nineteen hours a day I studied . 
For three months I kept this pace , only breaking it on several occasions . 
My body grew weary , my mind grew weary , but I stayed with it . 
My eyes grew weary and began to twitch , but they did not break down . 
Perhaps , toward the last , I got a bit dotty . 
I know that at the time I was confident , I had discovered the formula for squaring the circle but I resolutely deferred the working of it out until after the examinations . 
Then I would show them . 
Came the several days of the examinations , during which time I scarcely closed my eyes in sleep , devoting every moment to cramming and reviewing . 
And when I turned in my last examination paper I was in full possession of a splendid case of brain fag . 
I didn't want to see a book . 
I didn't want to think or to lay eyes on anybody who was liable to think . 
There was but one prescription for such a condition , and I gave it to myself the adventure path . 
I didn't wait to learn the result of my examinations . 
I stowed a roll of blankets and some cold food into a borrowed whitehall boat and set sail . 
Out of the Oakland Estuary I drifted on the last of an early morning ebb , caught the first of the flood up bay , and raced along with a spanking breeze . 
And right here something happened to me , the gravity of which I never dreamed for many a long year to come . 
I had had no intention of stopping at Benicia . 
The tide favoured , the wind was fair and howling glorious sailing for a sailor . 
Bull Head and Army Points showed ahead , marking the entrance to Suisun Bay which I knew was smoking . 
On the instant , out of the profound of my brain fag , I knew what I wanted . 
I wanted to get drunk . 
There was no uncertainty about it . 
More than anything else in the world , my frayed and frazzled mind wanted surcease from weariness in the way it knew surcease would come . 
And right here is the point . 
For the first time in my life I consciously , deliberately , desired to get drunk . 
It was a new , a totally different manifestation of John Barleycorn's power . 
It was not a body need for alcohol . 
It was a mental desire . 
My over worked and jaded mind wanted to forget . 
And here the point is drawn to its sharpest . 
Granted my prodigious brain fag , nevertheless , had I never drunk in the past , the thought would never have entered my mind to get drunk now . 
And had I not been so long used to alcohol , my brain would not have so cried out . 
So I sailed in to shore , made all fast , and hurried up among the arks . 
Charley Le Grant fell on my neck . 
His wife , Lizzie , folded me to her capacious breast . 
Billy Murphy , and Joe Lloyd , and all the survivors of the old guard , got around me and their arms around me . 
Charley seized the can and started for Jorgensen's saloon across the railroad tracks . 
I wanted whisky , so I called after him to bring a flask . 
Many times that flask journeyed across the railroad tracks and back . 
More old friends of the old free and easy times dropped in , fishermen , Greeks , and Russians , and French . 
They took turns in treating , and treated all around in turn again . 
They came and went , but I stayed on and drank with all . 
I ran the liquor down and joyed as the maggots mounted in my brain . 
And Clam came in , Nelson's partner before me , handsome as ever , but more reckless , half insane , burning himself out with whisky . 
They wanted me to stay over , but through the open door I could see the brave wind on the water , and my ears were filled with the roar of it . 
And while I forgot that I had plunged into the books nineteen hours a day for three solid months , Charley Le Grant shifted my outfit into a big Columbia River salmon boat . 
He added charcoal and a fisherman's brazier , a coffee pot and frying pan , and the coffee and the meat , and a black bass fresh from the water that day . 
They had to help me down the rickety wharf and into the salmon boat . 
Likewise they stretched my boom and sprit until the sail set like a board . 
Some feared to set the sprit but I insisted , and Charley had no doubts . 
He knew me of old , and knew that I could sail as long as I could see . 
They cast off my painter . 
I put the tiller up , filled away before it , and with dizzy eyes checked and steadied the boat on her course and waved farewell . 
The tide had turned , and the fierce ebb , running in the teeth of a fiercer wind , kicked up a stiff , upstanding sea . 
Suisun Bay was white with wrath and sea lump . 
But a salmon boat can sail , and I knew how to sail a salmon boat . 
So I drove her into it , and through it , and across , and maundered aloud and chanted my disdain for all the books and schools . 
Cresting seas filled me a foot or so with water , but I laughed at it sloshing about my feet , and chanted my disdain for the wind and the water . 
I hailed myself a master of life , riding on the back of the unleashed elements , and John Barleycorn rode with me . 
Here were old friends aboard , who fried my black bass in olive oil . 
CHAPTER XXIII My cruise in the salmon boat lasted a week , and I returned ready to enter the university . 
During the week's cruise I did not drink again . 
To accomplish this I was compelled to avoid looking up old friends , for as ever the adventure path was beset with John Barleycorn . 
I had wanted the drink that first day , and in the days that followed I did not want it . 
My tired brain had recuperated . 
I had no moral scruples in the matter . 
I was not ashamed nor sorry because of that first day's orgy at Benicia , and I thought no more about it , returning gladly to my books and studies . 
Long years were to pass ere I looked back upon that day and realised its significance . 
At the time , and for a long time afterward , I was to think of it only as a frolic . 
But still later , in the slough of brain fag and intellectual weariness , I was to remember and know the craving for the anodyne that resides in alcohol . 
In the meantime , after this one relapse at Benicia , I went on with my abstemiousness , primarily because I didn't want to drink . 
And next , I was abstemious because my way led among books and students where no drinking was . 
Had I been out on the adventure path , I should as a matter of course have been drinking . 
For that is the pity of the adventure path , which is one of John Barleycorn's favourite stamping grounds . 
I completed the first half of my freshman year , and in January of took up my courses for the second half . 
I was not very disappointed . 
For two years I had studied , and in those two years , what was far more valuable , I had done a prodigious amount of reading . 
Then , too , my grammar had improved . 
I decided immediately to embark on my career . 
I resolutely cut out music as impossible , settled down in my bedroom , and tackled my second , third , and fourth choices simultaneously . 
Heavens , how I wrote ! Never was there a creative fever such as mine from which the patient escaped fatal results . 
The way I worked was enough to soften my brain and send me to a mad house . 
On occasion I composed steadily , day after day , for fifteen hours a day . 
At times I forgot to eat , or refused to tear myself away from my passionate outpouring in order to eat . 
And then there was the matter of typewriting . 
My brother in law owned a machine which he used in the day time . 
In the night I was free to use it . 
That machine was a wonder . 
I could weep now as I recollect my wrestlings with it . 
It must have been a first model in the year one of the typewriter era . 
Its alphabet was all capitals . 
It was informed with an evil spirit . 
It obeyed no known laws of physics , and overthrew the hoary axiom that like things performed to like things produce like results . 
I'll swear that machine never did the same thing in the same way twice . 
Again and again it demonstrated that unlike actions produce like results . 
How my back used to ache with it ! Prior to that experience , my back had been good for every violent strain put upon it in a none too gentle career . 
But that typewriter proved to me that I had a pipe stem for a back . 
Also , it made me doubt my shoulders . 
They ached as with rheumatism after every bout . 
The keys of that machine had to be hit so hard that to one outside the house it sounded like distant thunder or some one breaking up the furniture . 
I had to hit the keys so hard that I strained my first fingers to the elbows , while the ends of my fingers were blisters burst and blistered again . 
Had it been my machine I'd have operated it with a carpenter's hammer . 
The worst of it was that I was actually typing my manuscripts at the same time I was trying to master that machine . 
Oh , between the writing and the typewriting I was well a weary . 
I had brain and nerve fag , and body fag as well , and yet the thought of drink never suggested itself . 
I was living too high to stand in need of an anodyne . 
All my waking hours , except those with that infernal typewriter , were spent in a creative heaven . 
But the waiting editors elected to keep on waiting . 
My manuscripts made amazing round trip records between the Pacific and the Atlantic . 
It might have been the weirdness of the typewriting that prevented the editors from accepting at least one little offering of mine . 
I don't know , and goodness knows the stuff I wrote was as weird as its typing . 
I sold my hard bought school books for ridiculous sums to second hand bookmen . 
I borrowed small sums of money wherever I could , and suffered my old father to feed me with the meagre returns of his failing strength . 
It didn't last long , only a few weeks , when I had to surrender and go to work . 
Yet I was unaware of any need for the drink anodyne . 
My career was retarded , that was all . 
Perhaps I did need further preparation . 
I had learned enough from the books to realise that I had only touched the hem of knowledge's garment . 
I still lived on the heights . 
My waking hours , and most of the hours I should have used for sleep , were spent with the books . 
CHAPTER XXIV Out in the country , at the Belmont Academy , I went to work in a small , perfectly appointed steam laundry . 
Another fellow and myself did all the work from sorting and washing to ironing the white shirts , collars and cuffs , and the fancy starch of the wives of the professors . 
We worked like tigers , especially as summer came on and the academy boys took to the wearing of duck trousers . 
It consumes a dreadful lot of time to iron one pair of duck trousers . 
And there were so many pairs of them . 
The hours were long , the work was arduous , despite the fact that we became past masters in the art of eliminating waste motion . 
, but which was to me the equivalent of twenty dollars a month . 
My robuster strength of added years , my increased skill , and all I had learned from the books , were responsible for this increase of twenty dollars . 
So relentlessly did my partner and I spring into our work throughout the week that by Saturday night we were frazzled wrecks . 
I found myself in the old familiar work beast condition , toiling longer hours than the horses toiled , thinking scarcely more frequent thoughts than horses think . 
The books were closed to me . 
I had brought a trunkful to the laundry , but found myself unable to read them . 
I fell asleep the moment I tried to read and if I did manage to keep my eyes open for several pages , I could not remember the contents of those pages . 
I gave over attempts on heavy study , such as jurisprudence , political economy , and biology , and tried lighter stuff , such as history . 
I tried literature , and fell asleep . 
And finally , when I fell asleep over lively novels , I gave up . 
I never succeeded in reading one book in all the time I spent in the laundry . 
And when Saturday night came , and the week's work was over until Monday morning , I knew only one desire besides the desire to sleep , and that was to get drunk . 
This was the second time in my life that I had heard the unmistakable call of John Barleycorn . 
The first time it had been because of brain fag . 
But I had no over worked brain now . 
On the contrary , all I knew was the dull numbness of a brain that was not worked at all . 
John Barleycorn makes his appeal to weakness and failure , to weariness and exhaustion . 
He is the easy way out . 
And he is lying all the time . 
He offers false strength to the body , false elevation to the spirit , making things seem what they are not and vastly fairer than what they are . 
But it must not be forgotten that John Barleycorn is protean . 
As well as to weakness and exhaustion , does he appeal to too much strength , to superabundant vitality , to the ennui of idleness . 
He can tuck in his arm the arm of any man in any mood . 
He can throw the net of his lure over all men . 
He exchanges new lamps for old , the spangles of illusion for the drabs of reality , and in the end cheats all who traffic with him . 
I didn't get drunk , however , for the simple reason that it was a mile and a half to the nearest saloon . 
And this , in turn , was because the call to get drunk was not very loud in my ears . 
Had it been loud , I would have travelled ten times the distance to win to the saloon . 
On the other hand , had the saloon been just around the corner , I should have got drunk . 
As it was , I would sprawl out in the shade on my one day of rest and dally with the Sunday papers . 
But I was too weary even for their froth . 
The comic supplement might bring a pallid smile to my face , and then I would fall asleep . 
Although I did not yield to John Barleycorn while working in the laundry , a certain definite result was produced . 
I had heard the call , felt the gnaw of desire , yearned for the anodyne . 
I was being prepared for the stronger desire of later years . 
And the point is that this development of desire was entirely in my brain . 
My body did not cry out for alcohol . 
As always , alcohol was repulsive to my body . 
When I was bodily weary from shovelling coal the thought of taking a drink had never flickered into my consciousness . 
When I was brain wearied after taking the entrance examinations to the university , I promptly got drunk . 
At the laundry I was suffering physical exhaustion again , and physical exhaustion that was not nearly so profound as that of the coal shovelling . 
But there was a difference . 
When I went coal shovelling my mind had not yet awakened . 
Between that time and the laundry my mind had found the kingdom of the mind . 
While shovelling coal my mind was somnolent . 
While toiling in the laundry my mind , informed and eager to do and be , was crucified . 
And whether I yielded to drink , as at Benicia , or whether I refrained , as at the laundry , in my brain the seeds of desire for alcohol were germinating . 
CHAPTER XXV After the laundry my sister and her husband grubstaked me into the Klondike . 
It was the first gold rush into that region , the early fall rush of . 
I was twenty one years old , and in splendid physical condition . 
The last pack into Linderman was three miles . 
I back tripped it four times a day , and on each forward trip carried one hundred and fifty pounds . 
This means that over the worst trails I daily travelled twenty four miles , twelve of which were under a burden of one hundred and fifty pounds . 
Yes , I had let career go hang , and was on the adventure path again in quest of fortune . 
And of course , on the adventure path , I met John Barleycorn . 
Here were the chesty men again , rovers and adventurers , and while they didn't mind a grub famine , whisky they could not do without . 
Whisky went over the trail , while the flour lay cached and untouched by the trail side . 
As good fortune would have it , the three men in my party were not drinkers . 
Therefore I didn't drink save on rare occasions and disgracefully when with other men . 
In my personal medicine chest was a quart of whisky . 
I never drew the cork till six months afterward , in a lonely camp , where , without anaesthetics , a doctor was compelled to operate on a man . 
The doctor and the patient emptied my bottle between them and then proceeded to the operation . 
Back in California a year later , recovering from scurvy , I found that my father was dead and that I was the head and the sole bread winner of a household . 
Work of any sort was difficult to get . 
And work of any sort was what I had to take , for I was still an unskilled labourer . 
I had no thought of career . 
That was over and done with . 
I had to find food for two mouths beside my own and keep a roof over our heads yes , and buy a winter suit , my one suit being decidedly summery . 
I had to get some sort of work immediately . 
After that , when I had caught my breath , I might think about my future . 
Unskilled labour is the first to feel the slackness of hard times , and I had no trades save those of sailor and laundryman . 
With my new responsibilities I didn't dare go to sea , and I failed to find a job at laundrying . 
I failed to find a job at anything . 
I had my name down in five employment bureaux . 
I advertised in three newspapers . 
I sought out the few friends I knew who might be able to get me work but they were either uninterested or unable to find anything for me . 
I pawned my watch , my bicycle , and a mackintosh of which my father had been very proud and which he had left to me . 
It was and is my sole legacy in this world . 
It had cost fifteen dollars , and the pawnbroker let me have two dollars on it . 
And oh , yes a water front comrade of earlier years drifted along one day with a dress suit wrapped in newspapers . 
He could give no adequate explanation of how he had come to possess it , nor did I press for an explanation . 
I wanted the suit myself . 
I traded him a lot of rubbish which , being unpawnable , was useless to me . 
He peddled the rubbish for several dollars , while I pledged the dress suit with my pawnbroker for five dollars . 
And for all I know the pawnbroker still has the suit . 
I had never intended to redeem it . 
But I couldn't get any work . 
Yet I was a bargain in the labour market . 
I tackled every opening for employment . 
I tried to become a studio model , but there were too many fine bodied young fellows out of jobs . 
I answered advertisements of elderly invalids in need of companions . 
And I almost became a sewing machine agent , on commission , without salary . 
But poor people don't buy sewing machines in hard times , so I was forced to forgo that employment . 
Of course , it must be remembered that along with such frivolous occupations I was trying to get work as wop , lumper , and roustabout . 
But winter was coming on , and the surplus labour army was pouring into the cities . 
Also I , who had romped along carelessly through the countries of the world and the kingdom of the mind , was not a member of any union . 
I worked days , and half days , at anything I could get . 
I mowed lawns , trimmed hedges , took up carpets , beat them , and laid them again . 
Further , I took the civil service examinations for mail carrier and passed first . 
But alas ! there was no vacancy , and I must wait . 
I didn't know the first thing about the newspaper game , but I was confident I'd get ten dollars for my article . 
The first San Francisco newspaper to which I mailed it never acknowledged receipt of the manuscript , but held on to it . 
The longer it held on to it the more certain I was that the thing was accepted . 
And here is the funny thing . 
Some are born to fortune , and some have fortune thrust upon them . 
But in my case I was clubbed into fortune , and bitter necessity wielded the club . 
I had long since abandoned all thought of writing as a career . 
My honest intention in writing that article was to earn ten dollars . 
And that was the limit of my intention . 
It would help to tide me along until I got steady employment . 
Had a vacancy occurred in the post office at that time , I should have jumped at it . 
But the vacancy did not occur , nor did a steady job and I employed the time between odd jobs with writing a twenty one thousand word serial for the Youth's Companion . 
I turned it out and typed it in seven days . 
I fancy that was what was the matter with it , for it came back . 
It took some time for it to go and come , and in the meantime I tried my hand at short stories . 
I sold one to the Overland Monthly for five dollars . 
The Black Cat gave me forty dollars for another . 
The Overland Monthly offered me seven dollars and a half , pay on publication , for all the stories I should deliver . 
I got my bicycle , my watch , and my father's mackintosh out of pawn and rented a typewriter . 
Also , I paid up the bills I owed to the several groceries that allowed me a small credit . 
I recall the Portuguese groceryman who never permitted my bill to go beyond four dollars . 
Hopkins , another grocer , could not be budged beyond five dollars . 
And just then came the call from the post office to go to work . 
It placed me in a most trying predicament . 
The sixty five dollars I could earn regularly every month was a terrible temptation . 
I couldn't decide what to do . 
And I'll never be able to forgive the postmaster of Oakland . 
I answered the call , and I talked to him like a man . 
I frankly told him the situation . 
It looked as if I might win out at writing . 
The chance was good , but not certain . 
Don't you see , if you will pass me over this time If you want it you will take it , he said coldly . 
Happily for me , the cursed brutality of the man made me angry . 
Very well , I said . 
CHAPTER XXVI Having burned my ship , I plunged into writing . 
I am afraid I always was an extremist . 
I managed on five hours' sleep in the twenty four , and came pretty close to working the nineteen waking hours left to me . 
My light burned till two and three in the morning , which led a good neighbour woman into a bit of sentimental Sherlock Holmes deduction . 
The trouble with the beginner at the writing game is the long , dry spells , when there is never an editor's cheque and everything pawnable is pawned . 
My difficulty was that I had no one to advise me . 
I didn't know a soul who had written or who had ever tried to write . 
I didn't even know one reporter . 
Also , to succeed at the writing game , I found I had to unlearn about everything the teachers and professors of literature of the high school and university had taught me . 
I was very indignant about this at the time though now I can understand it . 
They did not know the trick of successful writing in the years and . 
They knew all about Snow Bound and Sartor Resartus but the American editors of did not want such truck . 
They wanted the truck , and offered to pay so well for it that the teachers and professors of literature would have quit their jobs could they have supplied it . 
I struggled along , stood off the butcher and the grocer , pawned my watch and bicycle and my father's mackintosh , and I worked . 
I really did work , and went on short commons of sleep . 
Critics have complained about the swift education one of my characters , Martin Eden , achieved . 
In three years , from a sailor with a common school education , I made a successful writer of him . 
The critics say this is impossible . 
Yet I was Martin Eden . 
, was selling sociological articles to Cosmopolitan and McClure's , had declined an associate editorship proffered me by telegraph from New York City , and was getting ready to marry . 
Now the foregoing means work , especially the last year of it , when I was learning my trade as a writer . 
And in that year , running short on sleep and tasking my brain to its limit , I neither drank nor cared to drink . 
So far as I was concerned , alcohol did not exist . 
I did suffer from brain fag on occasion , but alcohol never suggested itself as an ameliorative . 
Heavens ! Editorial acceptances and cheques were all the amelioratives I needed . 
A thin envelope from an editor in the morning's mail was more stimulating than half a dozen cocktails . 
And if a cheque of decent amount came out of the envelope , such incident in itself was a whole drunk . 
Furthermore , at that time in my life I did not know what a cocktail was . 
I remember , when my first book was published , several Alaskans , who were members of the Bohemian Club , entertained me one evening at the club in San Francisco . 
We sat in most wonderful leather chairs , and drinks were ordered . 
Never had I heard such an ordering of liqueurs and of highballs of particular brands of Scotch . 
I didn't know what a liqueur or a highball was , and I didn't know that Scotch meant whisky . 
I knew only poor men's drinks , the drinks of the frontier and of sailor town cheap beer and cheaper whisky that was just called whisky and nothing else . 
I was embarrassed to make a choice , and the steward nearly collapsed when I ordered claret as an after dinner drink . 
CHAPTER XXVII As I succeeded with my writing , my standard of living rose and my horizon broadened . 
I confined myself to writing and typing a thousand words a day , including Sundays and holidays and I still studied hard , but not so hard as formerly . 
I allowed myself five and one half hours of actual sleep . 
I added this half hour because I was compelled . 
Financial success permitted me more time for exercise . 
And I learned that more sleep is required for physical exercise than for mental exercise . 
There were tired nights , bodily , when I slept six hours and on occasion of very severe exercise I actually slept seven hours . 
But such sleep orgies were not frequent . 
There was so much to learn , so much to be done , that I felt wicked when I slept seven hours . 
And I blessed the man who invented alarm clocks . 
And still no desire to drink . 
I possessed too many fine faiths , was living at too keen a pitch . 
I was a socialist , intent on saving the world , and alcohol could not give me the fervours that were mine from my ideas and ideals . 
My voice , on account of my successful writing , had added weight , or so I thought . 
At any rate , my reputation as a writer drew me audiences that my reputation as a speaker never could have drawn . 
I was invited before clubs and organisations of all sorts to deliver my message . 
I fought the good fight , and went on studying and writing , and was very busy . 
Up to this time I had had a very restricted circle of friends . 
But now I began to go about . 
I was invited out , especially to dinner , and I made many friends and acquaintances whose economic lives were easier than mine had been . 
And many of them drank . 
In their own houses they drank and offered me drink . 
They were not drunkards any of them . 
They just drank temperately , and I drank temperately with them as an act of comradeship and accepted hospitality . 
Well , I had a house . 
When one is asked into other houses , he naturally asks others into his house . 
Behold the rising standard of living . 
Having been given drink in other houses , I could expect nothing else of myself than to give drink in my own house . 
So I laid in a supply of beer and whisky and table claret . 
Never since that has my house not been well supplied . 
And still , through all this period , I did not care in the slightest for John Barleycorn . 
I drank when others drank , and with them , as a social act . 
And I had so little choice in the matter that I drank whatever they drank . 
If they elected whisky , then whisky it was for me . 
If they drank root beer or sarsaparilla , I drank root beer or sarsaparilla with them . 
And when there were no friends in the house , why , I didn't drink anything . 
Whisky decanters were always in the room where I wrote , and for months and years I never knew what it was , when by myself , to take a drink . 
When out at dinner I noticed the kindly , genial glow of the preliminary cocktail . 
It seemed a very fitting and gracious thing . 
On the other hand , I well remember a very brilliant man , somewhat older than I , who occasionally visited me . 
Besides , I no longer feared John Barleycorn . 
Mine was that most dangerous stage when a man believes himself John Barleycorn's master . 
I had proved it to my satisfaction in the long years of work and study . 
I could drink when I wanted , refrain when I wanted , drink without getting drunk , and to cap everything I was thoroughly conscious that I had no liking for the stuff . 
These brilliant ones , these adventurers of the mind , drank . 
There was no reason I should not drink with them I who knew so confidently that I had nothing to fear from John Barleycorn . 
And the foregoing was my attitude of mind for years . 
Occasionally I got well jingled , but such occasions were rare . 
It interfered with my work , and I permitted nothing to interfere with my work . 
Yet these very times were because I was out on the adventure path where John Barleycorn is always to be found . 
Then , too , with the certitude of long training and unholy intimacy , there were occasions when I engaged in drinking bouts with men . 
Of course , this was on the adventure path in various parts of the world , and it was a matter of pride . 
It is a queer man pride that leads one to drink with men in order to show as strong a head as they . 
But this queer man pride is no theory . 
For instance , a wild band of young revolutionists invited me as the guest of honour to a beer bust . 
It is the only technical beer bust I ever attended . 
I did not know the true inwardness of the affair when I accepted . 
I imagined that the talk would be wild and high , that some of them might drink more than they ought , and that I would drink discreetly . 
But it seemed these beer busts were a diversion of these high spirited young fellows whereby they whiled away the tedium of existence by making fools of their betters . 
As I learned afterward , they had got their previous guest of honour , a brilliant young radical , unskilled in drinking , quite pipped . 
When I found myself with them , and the situation dawned on me , up rose my queer man pride . 
I'd show them , the young rascals . 
These unlicked cubs who thought they could out drink ME ! You see , it was an endurance test , and no man likes to give another best . 
Faugh ! it was steam beer . 
I had learned more expensive brews . 
Not for years had I drunk steam beer but when I had , I had drunk with men , and I guessed I could show these youngsters some ability in beer guzzling . 
And the drinking began , and I had to drink with the best of them . 
Some of them might lag , but the guest of honour was not permitted to lag . 
And when the session broke up I was still on my feet , and I walked , erect , unswaying which was more than can be said of some of my hosts . 
I recall one of them in indignant tears on the street corner , weeping as he pointed out my sober condition . 
Yes , and mixed up with it all I was privily a grin . 
They hadn't made a fool of me in that drinking bout . 
And I was proud of myself for the achievement . 
Darn it , I am still proud , so strangely is man compounded . 
But I didn't write my thousand words next morning . 
I was sick , poisoned . 
It was a day of wretchedness . 
In the afternoon I had to give a public speech . 
I gave it , and I am confident it was as bad as I felt . 
Some of my hosts were there in the front rows to mark any signs on me of the night before . 
I don't know what signs they marked , but I marked signs on them and took consolation in the knowledge that they were just as sick as I. Never again , I swore . 
And I have never been inveigled into another beer bust . 
For that matter , that was my last drinking bout of any sort . 
Oh , I have drunk ever since , but with more wisdom , more discretion , and never in a competitive spirit . 
It is thus that the seasoned drinker grows seasoned . 
To show that at this period in my life drinking was wholly a matter of companionship , I remember crossing the Atlantic in the old Teutonic . 
It chanced , at the start , that I chummed with an English cable operator and a younger member of a Spanish shipping firm . 
Now the only thing they drank was horse's neck a long , soft , cool drink with an apple peel or an orange peel floating in it . 
And for that whole voyage I drank horse's , necks with my two companions . 
On the other hand , had they drunk whisky , I should have drunk whisky with them . 
From this it must not be concluded that I was merely weak . 
I had no morality in the matter . 
I was strong with youth , and unafraid , and alcohol was an utterly negligible question so far as I was concerned . 
CHAPTER XXVIII Not yet was I ready to tuck my arm in John Barleycorn's . 
And still I maintained no more than a nodding acquaintance with him . 
I drank for the sake of sociability , and when alone I did not drink . 
Sometimes I got jingled , but I considered such jingles the mild price I paid for sociability . 
I had life troubles and heart troubles which are neither here nor there in this narrative . 
But , combined with them , were intellectual troubles which are indeed germane . 
Mine was no uncommon experience . 
I had read too much positive science and lived too much positive life . 
In the eagerness of youth I had made the ancient mistake of pursuing Truth too relentlessly . 
I had torn her veils from her , and the sight was too terrible for me to stand . 
In brief , I lost my fine faiths in pretty well everything except humanity , and the humanity I retained faith in was a very stark humanity indeed . 
This long sickness of pessimism is too well known to most of us to be detailed here . 
Let it suffice to state that I had it very bad . 
I meditated suicide coolly , as a Greek philosopher might . 
My regret was that there were too many dependent directly upon me for food and shelter for me to quit living . 
But that was sheer morality . 
What really saved me was the one remaining illusion the PEOPLE . 
The things I had fought for and burned my midnight oil for had failed me . 
Recognition it was dead ashes . 
Society , men and women above the ruck and the muck of the water front and the forecastle I was appalled by their unlovely mental mediocrity . 
Love of woman it was like all the rest . 
From the foregoing it can be seen how very sick I was . 
I was born a fighter . 
The things I had fought for had proved not worth the fight . 
My fight was finished , yet something was left still to fight for the PEOPLE . 
Never the remotest whisper arose in my consciousness that John Barleycorn was the anodyne , that he could lie me along to live . 
One way only was uppermost in my thought my revolver , the crashing eternal darkness of a bullet . 
There was plenty of whisky in the house for my guests . 
I grew afraid of my revolver afraid during the period in which the radiant , flashing vision of the PEOPLE was forming in my mind and will . 
But the PEOPLE saved me . 
By the PEOPLE was I handcuffed to life . 
There was still one fight left in me , and here was the thing for which to fight . 
It was the PEOPLE , and no thanks to John Barleycorn , who pulled me through my long sickness . 
And when I was convalescent came the love of woman to complete the cure and lull my pessimism asleep for many a long day , until John Barleycorn again awoke it . 
But in the meantime , I pursued Truth less relentlessly , refraining from tearing her last veils aside even when I clutched them in my hand . 
I no longer cared to look upon Truth naked . 
I refused to permit myself to see a second time what I had once seen . 
And the memory of what I had that time seen I resolutely blotted from my mind . 
And I was very happy . 
Life went well with me , I took delight in little things . 
The big things I declined to take too seriously . 
I still read the books , but not with the old eagerness . 
The point of this chapter is that , in the long sickness that at some time comes to most of us , I came through without any appeal for aid to John Barleycorn . 
Love , socialism , the PEOPLE healthful figments of man's mind were the things that cured and saved me . 
If ever a man was not a born alcoholic , I believe that I am that man . 
CHAPTER XXIX After my long sickness my drinking continued to be convivial . 
I drank when others drank and I was with them . 
But , imperceptibly , my need for alcohol took form and began to grow . 
It was not a body need . 
I boxed , swam , sailed , rode horses , lived in the open an arrantly healthful life , and passed life insurance examinations with flying colours . 
In its inception , now that I look back upon it , this need for alcohol was a mental need , a nerve need , a good spirits need . 
How can I explain ? It was something like this . 
Physiologically , from the standpoint of palate and stomach , alcohol was , as it had always been , repulsive . 
It tasted no better than beer did when I was five , than bitter claret did when I was seven . 
When I was alone , writing or studying , I had no need for it . 
But I was growing old , or wise , or both , or senile as an alternative . 
When I was in company I was less pleased , less excited , with the things said and done . 
It is the penalty one pays for reading the books too much , or for being oneself a fool . 
In my case it does not matter which was my trouble . 
The trouble itself was the fact . 
The condition of the fact was mine . 
For me the life , and light , and sparkle of human intercourse were dwindling . 
I had climbed too high among the stars , or , maybe , I had slept too hard . 
Yet I was not hysterical nor in any way overwrought . 
My heart was an amazement of excellence to the insurance doctors . 
My lungs threw the said doctors into ecstasies . 
I wrote a thousand words every day . 
I was punctiliously exact in dealing with all the affairs of life that fell to my lot . 
I exercised in joy and gladness . 
I slept at night like a babe . 
But Well , as soon as I got out in the company of others I was driven to melancholy and spiritual tears . 
And I was not pessimistic . 
I swear I was not pessimistic . 
I had seen the same show too often , listened too often to the same songs and the same jokes . 
I knew too much about the box office receipts . 
It doesn't pay to go behind the scenes and see the angel voiced tenor beat his wife . 
Well , I'd been behind , and I was paying for it . 
Or else I was a fool . 
It is immaterial which was my situation . 
The situation is what counts , and the situation was that social intercourse for me was getting painful and difficult . 
I was married to a rare soul , or a fool , who never bored me and who was always a source of new and unending surprise and delight . 
But I could not spend all my hours solely in her company . 
Nor would it have been fair , nor wise , to compel her to spend all her hours in my company . 
Besides , I had written a string of successful books , and society demands some portion of the recreative hours of a fellow that writes books . 
And any normal man , of himself and his needs , demands some hours of his fellow men . 
And now we begin to come to it . 
How to face the social intercourse game with the glamour gone ? John Barleycorn . 
The ever patient one had waited a quarter of a century and more for me to reach my hand out in need of him . 
His thousand tricks had failed , thanks to my constitution and good luck , but he had more tricks in his bag . 
A cocktail or two , or several , I found , cheered me up for the foolishness of foolish people . 
A cocktail , or several , before dinner , enabled me to laugh whole heartedly at things which had long since ceased being laughable . 
The cocktail was a prod , a spur , a kick , to my jaded mind and bored spirits . 
A poor companion without a cocktail , I became a very good companion with one . 
I achieved a false exhilaration , drugged myself to merriment . 
And the thing began so imperceptibly that I , old intimate of John Barleycorn , never dreamed whither it was leading me . 
I was beginning to call for music and wine soon I should be calling for madder music and more wine . 
It was at this time I became aware of waiting with expectancy for the pre dinner cocktail . 
I WANTED it , and I was CONSCIOUS that I wanted it . 
I remember , while war corresponding in the Far East , of being irresistibly attracted to a certain home . 
Besides accepting all invitations to dinner , I made a point of dropping in almost every afternoon . 
Now , the hostess was a charming woman , but it was not for her sake that I was under her roof so frequently . 
It happened that she made by far the finest cocktail procurable in that large city where drink mixing on the part of the foreign population was indeed an art . 
Up at the club , down at the hotels , and in other private houses , no such cocktails were created . 
They were the least repulsive to the palate and carried the most kick . 
And yet , I desired her cocktails only for sociability's sake , to key myself to sociable moods . 
Several bottles of whisky were always to be found on the backs of my pack horses . 
Yet I never broached a bottle for myself , never took a drink by myself , and never knew a desire to take such a drink . 
I carried that whisky for social purposes , and I so charged it up in my expense account to the newspaper for which I worked . 
Only in retrospect can I mark the almost imperceptible growth of my desire . 
There were little hints then that I did not take , little straws in the wind that I did not see , little incidents the gravity of which I did not realise . 
For instance , for some years it had been my practice each winter to cruise for six or eight weeks on San Francisco Bay . 
My stout sloop yacht , the Spray , had a comfortable cabin and a coal stove . 
A Korean boy did the cooking , and I usually took a friend or so along to share the joys of the cruise . 
Also , I took my machine along and did my thousand words a day . 
On the particular trip I have in mind , Cloudesley and Toddy came along . 
This was Toddy's first trip . 
On previous trips Cloudesley had elected to drink beer so I had kept the yacht supplied with beer and had drunk beer with him . 
But on this cruise the situation was different . 
Toddy was so nicknamed because of his diabolical cleverness in concocting toddies . 
So I brought whisky along a couple of gallons . 
I grew to look forward to the making of them . 
We drank them regularly , one before breakfast , one before dinner , one before supper , and a final one when we went to bed . 
But I will say that four times a day we were very genial . 
But that was only on the boat . 
Back on the land , in my house , I took no before breakfast eye opener , no bed going nightcap . 
And I haven't drunk hot toddies since , and that was many a year ago . 
But the point is , I LIKED those toddies . 
The geniality of which they were provocative was marvellous . 
They were eloquent proselyters for John Barleycorn in their own small insidious way . 
They were tickles of the something destined to grow into daily and deadly desire . 
And I didn't know , never dreamed I , who had lived with John Barleycorn for so many years and laughed at all his unavailing attempts to win me . 
As a result , I grew tired of the city . 
On the ranch , in the Valley of the Moon , I found my paradise . 
I gave up living in cities . 
All the cities held for me were music , the theatre , and Turkish baths . 
And all went well with me . 
I worked hard , played hard , and was very happy . 
I read more fiction and less fact . 
I did not study a tithe as much as I had studied in the past . 
There was a bit of lie in this attitude of mine , a bit of hypocrisy but the lie and the hypocrisy were those of a man desiring to live . 
I deliberately blinded myself to what I took to be the savage interpretation of biological fact . 
After all , I was merely forswearing a bad habit , forgoing a bad frame of mind . 
And I repeat , I was very happy . 
Occasionally guests journeyed to the ranch and remained a few days . 
But to those who did drink , the absence of all alcohol on the ranch was a hardship . 
I could not violate my sense of hospitality by compelling them to endure this hardship . 
I ordered in a stock for my guests . 
I was never interested enough in cocktails to know how they were made . 
So I got a bar keeper in Oakland to make them in bulk and ship them to me . 
When I had no guests I didn't drink . 
But I began to notice , when I finished my morning's work , that I was glad if there were a guest , for then I could drink a cocktail with him . 
Now I was so clean of alcohol that even a single cocktail was provocative of pitch . 
A single cocktail would glow the mind and tickle a laugh for the few minutes prior to sitting down to table and starting the delightful process of eating . 
One day , a friend frankly and shamelessly suggested a second cocktail . 
I drank the second one with him . 
The glow was appreciably longer and warmer , the laughter deeper and more resonant . 
One does not forget such experiences . 
Sometimes I almost think that it was because I was so very happy that I started on my real drinking . 
I remember one day Charmian and I took a long ride over the mountains on our horses . 
The servants had been dismissed for the day , and we returned late at night to a jolly chafing dish supper . 
Oh , it was good to be alive that night while the supper was preparing , the two of us alone in the kitchen . 
I , personally , was at the top of life . 
Such things as the books and ultimate truth did not exist . 
My body was gloriously healthy , and healthily tired from the long ride . 
It had been a splendid day . 
I was with the woman who was my mate , picnicking in gleeful abandon . 
The bills were all paid , and a surplus of money was rolling in on me . 
The future ever widened before me . 
And right there , in the kitchen , delicious things bubbled in the chafing dish , our laughter bubbled , and my stomach was keen with a most delicious edge of appetite . 
I felt so good , that somehow , somewhere , in me arose an insatiable greed to feel better . 
I was so happy that I wanted to pitch my happiness even higher . 
And I knew the way . 
Ten thousand contacts with John Barleycorn had taught me . 
Several times I wandered out of the kitchen to the cocktail bottle , and each time I left it diminished by one man's size cocktail . 
I wasn't jingled , I wasn't lighted up but I was warmed , I glowed , my happiness was pyramided . 
Munificent as life was to me , I added to that munificence . 
It was a great hour one of my greatest . 
But I paid for it , long afterwards , as you will see . 
One does not forget such experiences , and , in human stupidity , cannot be brought to realise that there is no immutable law which decrees that same things shall produce same results . 
One day , just before I ate midday dinner , after my morning's writing was done , when I had no guest , I took a cocktail by myself . 
Thereafter , when there were no guests , I took this daily pre dinner cocktail . 
And right there John Barleycorn had me . 
I was beginning to drink regularly . 
I was beginning to drink alone . 
And I was beginning to drink , not for hospitality's sake , not for the sake of the taste , but for the effect of the drink . 
I WANTED that daily pre dinner cocktail . 
And it never crossed my mind that there was any reason I should not have it . 
I could pay for a thousand cocktails each day if I wanted . 
Odds and ends of correspondence and notes occupied me till nine , and at nine sharp , invariably , I began my writing . 
By eleven , sometimes a few minutes earlier or later , my thousand words were finished . 
At twelve thirty I ate dinner and in the afternoon I swam and rode . 
One morning , at eleven thirty , before I got into the hammock , I took a cocktail . 
I repeated this on subsequent mornings , of course , taking another cocktail just before I ate at twelve thirty . 
Soon I found myself , seated at my desk in the midst of my thousand words , looking forward to that eleven thirty cocktail . 
At last , now , I was thoroughly conscious that I desired alcohol . 
But what of it ? I wasn't afraid of John Barleycorn . 
I had associated with him too long . 
I was wise in the matter of drink . 
Never again would I drink to excess . 
I knew the dangers and the pitfalls of John Barleycorn , the various ways by which he had tried to kill me in the past . 
But all that was past , long past . 
Never again would I drink myself to stupefaction . 
Never again would I get drunk . 
Oh , I was thoroughly master of myself , and of John Barleycorn . 
CHAPTER XXXI But the same stimulus to the human organism will not continue to produce the same response . 
By and by I discovered there was no kick at all in one cocktail . 
One cocktail left me dead . 
There was no glow , no laughter tickle . 
Two or three cocktails were required to produce the original effect of one . 
And I wanted that effect . 
I drank my first cocktail at eleven thirty when I took the morning's mail into the hammock , and I drank my second cocktail an hour later just before I ate . 
I got into the habit of crawling out of the hammock ten minutes earlier so as to find time and decency for two more cocktails ere I ate . 
This became schedule three cocktails in the hour that intervened between my desk and dinner . 
And these are two of the deadliest drinking habits regular drinking and solitary drinking . 
I was always willing to drink when any one was around . 
I drank by myself when no one was around . 
Then I made another step . 
But John Barleycorn furnished the extenuation . 
It was a wrong thing to trip a guest up with excess of hospitality and get him drunk . 
If I persuaded him , with his limited calibre , into drinking up with me , I'd surely get him drunk . 
My body is a strong body . 
It has survived where weaklings died like flies . 
And yet these things which I am relating happened to my body and to me . 
My drinking is a fact . 
A cocktail before supper was not the way . 
Two or three , at the very least , was what was needed . 
Why not ? It was living . 
I had always dearly loved to live . 
This also became part of the daily schedule . 
Then , too , I was perpetually finding excuses for extra cocktails . 
It was immaterial what the excuse might be , once the desire had germinated in me . 
The thing was I WANTED alcohol . 
At last , after a score and more of years of dallying and of not wanting , now I wanted it . 
And my strength was my weakness . 
I required two , three , or four drinks to get an effect commensurate with the effect the average man got out of one drink . 
I never took a drink until my day's work of writing a thousand words was done . 
And , when done , the cocktails reared a wall of inhibition in my brain between the day's work done and the rest of the day of fun to come . 
My work ceased from my consciousness . 
No thought of it flickered in my brain till next morning at nine o'clock when I sat at my desk and began my next thousand words . 
This was a desirable condition of mind to achieve . 
I conserved my energy by means of this alcoholic inhibition . 
John Barleycorn was not so black as he was painted . 
He did a fellow many a good turn , and this was one of them . 
And I turned out work that was healthful , and wholesome , and sincere . 
The way to life I had learned in my long sickness . 
I knew the illusions were right , and I exalted the illusions . 
Oh , I still turn out the same sort of work , stuff that is clean , alive , optimistic , and that makes toward life . 
And I am always assured by the critics of my super abundant and abounding vitality , and of how thoroughly I am deluded by these very illusions I exploit . 
And while on this digression , let me repeat the question I have repeated to myself ten thousand times . 
WHY DID I DRINK ? What need was there for it ? I was happy . 
Was it because I was too happy ? I was strong . 
Was it because I was too strong ? Did I possess too much vitality ? I don't know why I drank . 
I cannot answer , though I can voice the suspicion that ever grows in me . 
I had been in too familiar contact with John Barleycorn through too many years . 
A left handed man , by long practice , can become a right handed man . 
Had I , a non alcoholic , by long practice become an alcoholic ? I was so happy . 
I had won through my long sickness to the satisfying love of woman . 
I earned more money with less endeavour . 
I slept like a babe . 
I continued to write successful books , and in sociological controversy I saw my opponents confuted with the facts of the times that daily reared new buttresses to my intellectual position . 
From day's end to day's end I never knew sorrow , disappointment , nor regret . 
I was happy all the time . 
Life was one unending song . 
I begrudged the very hours of blessed sleep because by that much was I robbed of the joy that would have been mine had I remained awake . 
And John Barleycorn , all unguessed by me , was setting the stage for a sickness all his own . 
The more I drank the more I was required to drink to get an equivalent effect . 
When I left the Valley of the Moon , and went to the city , and dined out , a cocktail served at table was a wan and worthless thing . 
There was no pre dinner kick in it . 
Once , I was in a rush . 
I had no time decently to accumulate the several drinks . 
A brilliant idea came to me . 
I told the barkeeper to mix me a double cocktail . 
Thereafter , whenever I was in a hurry , I ordered double cocktails . 
One result of this regular heavy drinking was to jade me . 
My mind grew so accustomed to spring and liven by artificial means that without artificial means it refused to spring and liven . 
Alcohol became more and more imperative in order to meet people , in order to become sociably fit . 
Another result was that John Barleycorn was beginning to trip me up . 
He was thrusting my long sickness back upon me , inveigling me into again pursuing Truth and snatching her veils away from her , tricking me into looking reality stark in the face . 
But this came on gradually . 
My thoughts were growing harsh again , though they grew harsh slowly . 
Sometimes warning thoughts crossed my mind . 
Where was this steady drinking leading ? But trust John Barleycorn to silence such questions . 
Come on and have a drink and I'll tell you all about it , is his way . 
For instance , the following is a case in point , and one which John Barleycorn never wearied of reminding me I had suffered an accident which required a ticklish operation . 
One morning , a week after I had come off the table , I lay on my hospital bed , weak and weary . 
The sunburn of my face , what little of it could be seen through a scraggly growth of beard , had faded to a sickly yellow . 
My doctor stood at my bedside on the verge of departure . 
He glared disapprovingly at the cigarette I was smoking . 
That's what you ought to quit , he lectured . 
It will get you in the end . 
He was about my own age , broad shouldered , deep chested , eyes sparkling , and ruddy cheeked with health . 
A finer specimen of manhood one would not ask . 
I used to smoke , he went on . 
But I gave even them up . 
The man was arrogant , and rightly arrogant , with conscious well being . 
And within a month he was dead . 
Half a dozen different bugs of long scientific names had attacked and destroyed him . 
The complications were astonishing and painful , and for days before he died the screams of agony of that splendid manhood could be heard for a block around . 
You see , said John Barleycorn . 
He took care of himself . 
He even stopped smoking cigars . 
And that's what he got for it . 
Pretty rotten , eh ? But the bugs will jump . 
Your magnificent doctor took every precaution , yet they got him . 
When the bug jumps you can't tell where it will land . 
Will you miss all I can give you , only to have a bug jump on you and drag you down ? There is no equity in life . 
But I put the lying smile on the face of life and laugh at the facts . 
Smile with me and laugh . 
You'll get yours in the end , but in the meantime laugh . 
It's a pretty dark world . 
I illuminate it for you . 
It's a rotten world , when things can happen such as happened to your doctor . 
There's only one thing to do take another drink and forget it . 
And , of course , I took another drink for the inhibition that accompanied it . 
I took another drink every time John Barleycorn reminded me of what had happened . 
Yet I drank rationally , intelligently . 
I saw to it that the quality of the stuff was of the best . 
I sought the kick and the inhibition , and avoided the penalties of poor quality and of drunkenness . 
But I continued to observe my rule of never taking my first drink of the day until the last word of my thousand words was written . 
On occasion , however , I took a day's vacation from my writing . 
At such times , since it was no violation of my rule , I didn't mind how early in the day I took that first drink . 
Or , rather , we were all of us unaware that there was anything to drink , nor did we discover it for many a month . 
This sailing with a dry boat was malice aforethought on my part . 
I had played John Barleycorn a trick . 
And it showed that I was listening ever so slightly to the faint warnings that were beginning to arise in my consciousness . 
Of course , I veiled the situation to myself and excused myself to John Barleycorn . 
And I was very scientific about it . 
I said that I would drink only while in ports . 
His bite would be sharper , his kick keener and more delicious . 
We were twenty seven days on the traverse between San Francisco and Honolulu . 
After the first day out , the thought of a drink never troubled me . 
This I take to show how intrinsically I am not an alcoholic . 
, I thought , naturally , of the drinks that would precede those meals . 
I did not think of those drinks with any yearning , with any irk at the length of the voyage . 
I merely thought they would be nice and jolly , part of the atmosphere of a proper meal . 
Thus , once again I proved to my complete satisfaction that I was John Barleycorn's master . 
I could drink when I wanted , refrain when I wanted . 
Therefore I would continue to drink when I wanted . 
Some five months were spent in the various islands of the Hawaiian group . 
Being ashore , I drank . 
I even drank a bit more than I had been accustomed to drink in California prior to the voyage . 
The people in Hawaii seemed to drink a bit more , on the average , than the people in more temperate latitudes . 
I do not intend the pun , and can awkwardly revise the statement to latitudes more remote from the equator Yet Hawaii is only sub tropical . 
The deeper I got into the tropics , the deeper I found men drank , the deeper I drank myself . 
From Hawaii we sailed for the Marquesas . 
The traverse occupied sixty days . 
For sixty days we never raised land , a sail , nor a steamer smoke . 
But early in those sixty days the cook , giving an overhauling to the galley , made a find . 
Down in the bottom of a deep locker he found a dozen bottles of angelica and muscatel . 
These had come down from the kitchen cellar of the ranch along with the home preserved fruits and jellies . 
Six months in the galley heat had effected some sort of a change in the thick sweet wine branded it , I imagine . 
Delicious ! And thereafter , once each day , at twelve o'clock , after our observations were worked up and the Snark's position charted , I drank half a tumbler of the stuff . 
It had a rare kick to it . 
It warmed the cockles of my geniality and put a fairer face on the truly fair face of the sea . 
Each morning , below , sweating out my thousand words , I found myself looking forward to that twelve o'clock event of the day . 
The trouble was I had to share the stuff , and the length of the traverse was doubtful . 
I regretted that there were not more than a dozen bottles . 
And when they were gone I even regretted that I had shared any of it . 
I was thirsty for the alcohol , and eager to arrive in the Marquesas . 
So it was that I reached the Marquesas the possessor of a real man's size thirst . 
The trade rum scorched the skin off one's mouth . 
I know , because I tried it . 
But I had ever been plastic , and I accepted the absinthe . 
The trouble with the stuff was that I had to take such inordinate quantities in order to feel the slightest effect . 
But please do not misunderstand . 
There was no drunkenness , as drunkenness is ordinarily understood no staggering and rolling around , no befuddlement of the senses . 
The skilled and seasoned drinker , with a strong constitution , never descends to anything like that . 
He drinks to feel good , to get a pleasant jingle , and no more than that . 
The things he carefully avoids are the nausea of over drinking , the after effect of over drinking , the helplessness and loss of pride of over drinking . 
What the skilled and seasoned drinker achieves is a discreet and canny semi intoxication . 
And he does it by the twelve month around without any apparent penalty . 
And all of them fondly believe , as I fondly believed , that they are beating the game . 
On the sea stretches I was fairly abstemious but ashore I drank more . 
I seemed to need more , anyway , in the tropics . 
This is a common experience , for the excessive consumption of alcohol in the tropics by white men is a notorious fact . 
The tropics is no place for white skinned men . 
Their skin pigment does not protect them against the excessive white light of the sun . 
White men in the tropics undergo radical changes of nature . 
They become savage , merciless . 
They commit monstrous acts of cruelty that they would never dream of committing in their original temperate climate . 
They become nervous , irritable , and less moral . 
And they drink as they never drank before . 
Drinking is one form of the many forms of degeneration that set in when white men are exposed too long to too much white light . 
The increase of alcoholic consumption is automatic . 
The tropics is no place for a long sojourn . 
They seem doomed to die anyway , and the heavy drinking expedites the process . 
They don't reason about it . 
The sun sickness got me , despite the fact that I had been in the tropics only a couple of years . 
I drank heavily during this time , but right here I wish to forestall misunderstanding . 
The drinking was not the cause of the sickness , nor of the abandonment of the voyage . 
I was strong as a bull , and for many months I fought the sun sickness that was ripping and tearing my surface and nervous tissues to pieces . 
To navigate a vessel through the reefs and shoals and passages and unlighted coasts of the coral seas is a man's work in itself . 
I was the only navigator on board . 
There was no one to check me up on the working out of my observations , nor with whom I could advise in the ticklish darkness among uncharted reefs and shoals . 
And I stood all watches . 
There was no sea man on board whom I could trust to stand a mate's watch . 
I was mate as well as captain . 
Twenty four hours a day were the watches I stood at sea , catching cat naps when I might . 
Third , I was doctor . 
And let me say right here that the doctor's job on the Snark at that time was a man's job . 
All on board suffered from malaria the real , tropical malaria that can kill in three months . 
All on board suffered from perforating ulcers and from the maddening itch of ngari ngari . 
A Japanese cook went insane from his too numerous afflictions . 
One of my Polynesian sailors lay at death's door with blackwater fever . 
Oh , yes , it was a full man's job , and I dosed and doctored , and pulled teeth , and dragged my patients through mild little things like ptomaine poisoning . 
Fourth , I was a writer . 
Fifth , I was a traveller and a writer , eager to see things and to gather material into my note books . 
And , sixth , I was master and owner of the craft that was visiting strange places where visitors are rare and where visitors are made much of . 
I drank with my guests and hosts . 
Also , I drank by myself . 
Doing the work of five men , I thought , entitled me to drink . 
Alcohol was good for a man who over worked . 
They caught their breaths , wiped their mouths , and went to it again with a will . 
And when we careened the Snark and had to work in the water to our necks between shocks of fever , I noted how raw trade rum helped the work along . 
And here again we come to another side of many sided John Barleycorn . 
On the face of it , he gives something for nothing . 
Where no strength remains he finds new strength . 
The wearied one rises to greater effort . 
For the time being there is an actual accession of strength . 
I remember passing coal on an ocean steamer through eight days of hell , during which time we coal passers were kept to the job by being fed with whisky . 
We toiled half drunk all the time . 
And without the whisky we could not have passed the coal . 
This strength John Barleycorn gives is not fictitious strength . 
But it is manufactured out of the sources of strength , and it must ultimately be paid for , and with interest . 
But what weary human will look so far ahead ? He takes this apparently miraculous accession of strength at its face value . 
And many an overworked business and professional man , as well as a harried common labourer , has travelled John Barleycorn's death road because of this mistake . 
CHAPTER XXXIII I went to Australia to go into hospital and get tinkered up , after which I planned to go on with the voyage . 
And during the long weeks I lay in hospital , from the first day I never missed alcohol . 
I never thought about it . 
I knew I should have it again when I was on my feet . 
But when I regained my feet I was not cured of my major afflictions . 
Naaman's silvery skin was still mine . 
The mysterious sun sickness , which the experts of Australia could not fathom , still ripped and tore my tissues . 
Malaria still festered in me and put me on my back in shivering delirium at the most unexpected moments , compelling me to cancel a double lecture tour which had been arranged . 
So I abandoned the Snark voyage and sought a cooler climate . 
The day I came out of hospital I took up drinking again as a matter of course . 
I drank wine at meals . 
I drank cocktails before meals . 
I drank Scotch highballs when anybody I chanced to be with was drinking them . 
I was so thoroughly the master of John Barleycorn I could take up with him or let go of him whenever I pleased , just as I had done all my life . 
After a time , for cooler climate , I went down to southermost Tasmania in forty three South . 
And I found myself in a place where there was nothing to drink . 
I soaked in the cool air , rode horseback , and did my thousand words a day save when the fever shock came in the morning . 
When I returned to Hobart Town , where drink was obtainable , I drank as of old . 
The same when I arrived back in Australia . 
I caught none of these diseases . 
Neither did Charmian nor Nakata who did not drink . 
Enamoured of the tropics , despite the damage done me , I stopped in various places , and was a long while getting back to the splendid , temperate climate of California . 
CHAPTER XXXIV Back on the ranch , in the Valley of the Moon , I resumed my steady drinking . 
My programme was no drink in the morning first drink time came with the completion of my thousand words . 
Then , between that and the midday meal , were drinks numerous enough to develop a pleasant jingle . 
Again , in the hour preceding the evening meal , I developed another pleasant jingle . 
Nobody ever saw me drunk , for the simple reason that I never was drunk . 
It was the old proposition . 
The more I drank , the more I was compelled to drink in order to get an effect . 
The time came when cocktails were inadequate . 
I had neither the time in which to drink them nor the space to accommodate them . 
Whisky had a more powerful jolt . 
It gave quicker action with less quantity . 
Bourbon or rye , or cunningly aged blends , constituted the pre midday drinking . 
In the late afternoon it was Scotch and soda . 
My sleep , always excellent , now became not quite so excellent . 
I had been accustomed to read myself back asleep when I chanced to awake . 
But now this began to fail me . 
When I had read two or three of the small hours away and was as wide awake as ever , I found that a drink furnished the soporific effect . 
Sometimes two or three drinks were required . 
So short a period of sleep then intervened before early morning rising that my system did not have time to work off the alcohol . 
As a result I awoke with mouth parched and dry , with a slight heaviness of head , and with a mild nervous palpitation in the stomach . 
In fact I did not feel good . 
I was suffering from the morning sickness of the steady , heavy drinker . 
What I needed was a pick me up , a bracer . 
I achieved a condition in which my body was never free from alcohol . 
Nor did I permit myself to be away from alcohol . 
If I travelled to out of the way places , I declined to run the risk of finding them dry . 
I took a quart , or several quarts , along in my grip . 
In the past I had been amazed by other men guilty of this practice . 
Now I did it myself unblushingly . 
And when I got out with the fellows , I cast all rules by the board . 
I drank when they drank , what they drank , and in the same way they drank . 
I was carrying a beautiful alcoholic conflagration around with me . 
The thing fed on its own heat and flamed the fiercer . 
There was no time , in all my waking time , that I didn't want a drink . 
I began to anticipate the completion of my daily thousand words by taking a drink when only five hundred words were written . 
It was not long until I prefaced the beginning of the thousand words with a drink . 
The gravity of this I realised too well . 
Resolutely I would refrain from drinking until my work was done . 
But a new and most diabolical complication arose . 
The work refused to be done without drinking . 
It just couldn't be done . 
I had to drink in order to do it . 
I was beginning to fight now . 
I had the craving at last , and it was mastering me . 
I would sit at my desk and dally with pad and pen , but words refused to flow . 
My brain could not think the proper thoughts because continually it was obsessed with the one thought that across the room in the liquor cabinet stood John Barleycorn . 
When , in despair , I took my drink , at once my brain loosened up and began to roll off the thousand words . 
In my town house , in Oakland , I finished the stock of liquor and wilfully refused to purchase more . 
It was no use , because , unfortunately , there remained in the bottom of the liquor cabinet a case of beer . 
In vain I tried to write . 
Not until I had drunk a pint of it did the words begin to reel off , and the thousand were reeled off to the tune of numerous pints . 
The worst of it was that the beer caused me severe heart burn but despite the discomfort I soon finished off the case . 
The liquor cabinet was now bare . 
I did not replenish it . 
By truly heroic perseverance I finally forced myself to write the daily thousand words without the spur of John Barleycorn . 
But all the time I wrote I was keenly aware of the craving for a drink . 
And as soon as the morning's work was done , I was out of the house and away down town to get my first drink . 
John Barleycorn began to collect , and he collected not so much from the body as from the mind . 
The old long sickness , which had been purely an intellectual sickness , recrudesced . 
The old ghosts , long laid , lifted their heads again . 
But they were different and more deadly ghosts . 
The old ghosts , intellectual in their inception , had been laid by a sane and normal logic . 
But now they were raised by the White Logic of John Barleycorn , and John Barleycorn never lays the ghosts of his raising . 
For this sickness of pessimism , caused by drink , one must drink further in quest of the anodyne that John Barleycorn promises but never delivers . 
How to describe this White Logic to those who have never experienced it ! It is perhaps better first to state how impossible such a description is . 
Take Hasheesh Land , for instance , the land of enormous extensions of time and space . 
In past years I have made two memorable journeys into that far land . 
My adventures there are seared in sharpest detail on my brain . 
Yet I have tried vainly , with endless words , to describe any tiny particular phase to persons who have not travelled there . 
I talk for an hour , elaborating that one phase of Hasheesh Land , and at the end I have told them nothing . 
And when I cannot tell them this one thing of all the vastness of terrible and wonderful things , I know I have failed to give them the slightest concept of Hasheesh Land . 
But let me talk with some other traveller in that weird region , and at once am I understood . 
A phrase , a word , conveys instantly to his mind what hours of words and phrases could not convey to the mind of the non traveller . 
So it is with John Barleycorn's realm where the White Logic reigns . 
To those untravelled there , the traveller's account must always seem unintelligible and fantastic . 
At the best , I may only beg of the untravelled ones to strive to take on faith the narrative I shall relate . 
For there are fatal intuitions of truth that reside in alcohol . 
Philip sober vouches for Philip drunk in this matter . 
There seem to be various orders of truth in this world . 
Some sorts of truth are truer than others . 
Some sorts of truth are lies , and these sorts are the very ones that have the greatest use value to life that desires to realise and live . 
At once , O untravelled reader , you see how lunatic and blasphemous is the realm I am trying to describe to you in the language of John Barleycorn's tribe . 
It is not the language of your tribe , all of whose members resolutely shun the roads that lead to death and tread only the roads that lead to life . 
For there are roads and roads , and of truth there are orders and orders . 
At least , through what seems no more than verbal yammerings , you may , perchance , glimpse faint far vistas of other lands and tribes . 
Alcohol tells truth , but its truth is not normal . 
What is normal is healthful . 
What is healthful tends toward life . 
Normal truth is a different order , and a lesser order , of truth . 
to the chicken farm , the hide house , the glue rendering works , and the bone meal fertiliser factory . 
To the last stumble of its stumbling end this dray horse must abide by the mandates of the lesser truth that is the truth of life and that makes life possible to persist . 
This dray horse , like all other horses , like all other animals , including man , is life blinded and sense struck . 
It will live , no matter what the price . 
The game of life is good , though all of life may be hurt , and though all lives lose the game in the end . 
This is the order of truth that obtains , not for the universe , but for the live things in it if they for a little space will endure ere they pass . 
To man , alone among the animals , has been given the awful privilege of reason . 
Man , with his brain , can penetrate the intoxicating show of things and look upon the universe brazen with indifference toward him and his dreams . 
He can do this , but it is not well for him to do it . 
, it is good that man be life blinded and sense struck . 
What is good is true . 
It is good that man should accept at face value the cheats of sense and snares of flesh and through the fogs of sentiency pursue the lures and lies of passion . 
It is good that he shall see neither shadows nor futilities , nor be appalled by his lusts and rapacities . 
Countless men have glimpsed that other and truer order of truth and recoiled from it . 
Countless men have passed through the long sickness and lived to tell of it and deliberately to forget it to the end of their days . 
They realised life , for life is what they were . 
And now comes John Barleycorn with the curse he lays upon the imaginative man who is lusty with life and desire to live . 
John Barleycorn will not let the dreamer dream , the liver live . 
And the feet of the victim of such dreadful intimacy take hold of the way of death . 
CHAPTER XXXVI Back to personal experiences and the effects in the past of John Barleycorn's White Logic on me . 
In vain do I ask myself why I should be sad . 
My roof does not leak . 
I have food galore for all the caprices of appetite . 
Every creature comfort is mine . 
In my body are no aches nor pains . 
The good old flesh machine is running smoothly on . 
Neither brain nor muscle is overworked . 
I have done , and am doing , what a good citizen of the world should do . 
I have built houses , many houses , and tilled many a hundred acres . 
My life has indeed fallen in pleasant places . 
Not a hundred men in a million have been so lucky as I. Yet , with all this vast good fortune , am I sad . 
And I am sad because John Barleycorn is with me . 
And John Barleycorn is with me because I was born in what future ages will call the dark ages before the ages of rational civilisation . 
The pseudo civilisation into which I was born permitted everywhere licensed shops for the sale of soul poison . 
was lured and drawn and driven to the poison shops . 
Wander with me through one mood of the myriad moods of sadness into which one is plunged by John Barleycorn . 
I ride out over my beautiful ranch . 
Between my legs is a beautiful horse . 
The grapes on a score of rolling hills are red with autumn flame . 
Across Sonoma Mountain wisps of sea fog are stealing . 
The afternoon sun smoulders in the drowsy sky . 
I have everything to make me glad I am alive . 
I am filled with dreams and mysteries . 
I am all sun and air and sparkle . 
I am vitalised , organic . 
I move , I have the power of movement , I command movement of the live thing I bestride . 
I am possessed with the pomps of being , and know proud passions and inspirations . 
I have ten thousand august connotations . 
I am a king in the kingdom of sense , and trample the face of the uncomplaining dust . 
I remember the men who broke their hearts and their backs over this stubborn soil that now belongs to me . 
As if anything imperishable could belong to the perishable ! These men passed . 
I , too , shall pass . 
And I know that I , too , shall some day , and soon , be gone . 
Gone ? I am going now . 
In my jaw are cunning artifices of the dentists which replace the parts of me already gone . 
Never again will I have the thumbs of my youth . 
Old fights and wrestlings have injured them irreparably . 
That punch on the head of a man whose very name is forgotten settled this thumb finally and for ever . 
A slip grip at catch as catch can did for the other . 
My lean runner's stomach has passed into the limbo of memory . 
Never again can I swing dizzily aloft and trust all the proud quick that is I to a single rope clutch in the driving blackness of storm . 
Never again can I run with the sled dogs along the endless miles of Arctic trail . 
All of which does not shudder me . 
To be afraid is to be healthy . 
Fear of death makes for life . 
But the curse of the White Logic is that it does not make one afraid . 
The world sickness of the White Logic makes one grin jocosely into the face of the Noseless One and to sneer at all the phantasmagoria of living . 
I look about me as I ride and on every hand I see the merciless and infinite waste of natural selection . 
The White Logic insists upon opening the long closed books , and by paragraph and chapter states the beauty and wonder I behold in terms of futility and dust . 
About me is murmur and hum , and I know it for the gnat swarm of the living , piping for a little space its thin plaint of troubled air . 
I return across the ranch . 
Twilight is on , and the hunting animals are out . 
I watch the piteous tragic play of life feeding on life . 
Only in man is morality , and man created it a code of action that makes toward living and that is of the lesser order of truth . 
Yet all this I knew before , in the weary days of my long sickness . 
I did but stir them , and let them lie . 
I was too wise , too wicked wise , to wake them . 
But now White Logic willy nilly wakes them for me , for White Logic , most valiant , is unafraid of all the monsters of the earthly dream . 
Let the doctors of all the schools condemn me , White Logic whispers as I ride along . 
What of it ? I am truth . 
They say I make for death . 
What of it ? It is truth . 
Life lies in order to live . 
Life is a perpetual lie telling process . 
Life is a mad dance in the domain of flux , wherein appearances in mighty tides ebb and flow , chained to the wheels of moons beyond our ken . 
You are such an appearance , composed of countless appearances out of the past . 
All an appearance can know is mirage . 
You know mirages of desire . 
Life is apparitional , and passes . 
And of course it is all unanswerable , and as I ride along through the evening shadows I sneer at that Great Fetish which Comte called the world . 
And I remember what another pessimist of sentiency has uttered Transient are all . 
They , being born , must die , and , being dead , are glad to be at rest . 
But here through the dusk comes one who is not glad to be at rest . 
He is a workman on the ranch , an old man , an immigrant Italian . 
He takes his hat off to me in all servility , because , forsooth , I am to him a lord of life . 
I am food to him , and shelter , and existence . 
He has toiled like a beast all his days , and lived less comfortably than my horses in their deep strawed stalls . 
He shambles as he walks . 
One shoulder is twisted higher than the other . 
His hands are gnarled claws , repulsive , horrible . 
As an apparition he is a pretty miserable specimen . 
His brain is as stupid as his body is ugly . 
His brain is so stupid that he does not know he is an apparition , the White Logic chuckles to me . 
He is the slave of the dream of life . 
His brain is filled with superrational sanctions and obsessions . 
He believes in a transcendent over world . 
He has listened to the vagaries of the prophets , who have given to him the sumptuous bubble of Paradise . 
He feels inarticulate self affinities , with self conjured non realities . 
He sees penumbral visions of himself titubating fantastically through days and nights of space and stars . 
He is brother as well to the gorilla and the chimpanzee . 
He thumps his chest in anger , and roars and quivers with cataleptic ferocity . 
He knows monstrous , atavistic promptings , and he is composed of all manner of shreds of abysmal and forgotten instincts . 
Yet he dreams he is immortal , I argue feebly . 
It is vastly wonderful for so stupid a clod to bestride the shoulders of time and ride the eternities . 
Pah ! is the retort . 
Oh well , here's the house . 
Cheer up and take a drink . 
We know , we illuminated , you and I , all the folly and the farce . 
Drink , says the White Logic . 
The Greeks believed that the gods gave them wine so that they might forget the miserableness of existence . 
And remember what Heine said . 
Your clear white light is sickness , I tell the White Logic . 
By telling too strong a truth , he quips back . 
Alas , yes , so topsy turvy is existence , I acknowledge sadly . 
Ah , well , Liu Ling was wiser than you , the White Logic girds . 
It was Liu Ling , prompts the White Logic , who declared that to a drunken man the affairs of this world appear but as so much duckweed on a river . 
Have another Scotch , and let semblance and deception become duck weed on a river . 
Those who dream of lamentation and sorrow , wake to join the hunt . 
While they dream , they do not know that they dream . 
Some will even interpret the very dream they are dreaming and only when they awake do they know it was a dream . 
Fools think they are awake now , and flatter themselves they know if they are really princes or peasants . 
Confucius and you are both dreams and I who say you are dreams I am but a dream myself . 
Once upon a time , I , Chuang Tzu , dreamt I was a butterfly , fluttering hither and thither , to all intents and purposes a butterfly . 
I was conscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly , and was unconscious of my individuality as a man . 
Suddenly , I awaked , and there I lay , myself again . 
Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly , or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man . 
CHAPTER XXXVII Come , says the White Logic , and forget these Asian dreamers of old time . 
Fill your glass and let us look at the parchments of the dreamers of yesterday who dreamed their dreams on your own warm hills . 
I pore over the abstract of title of the vineyard called Tokay on the rancho called Petaluma . 
Immediately this musty record of man's land lust assumes the formidableness of a battle the quick struggling with the dust . 
It is like a monster ever unsubdued , this stubborn land that drowses in this Indian summer weather and that survives them all , the men who scratched its surface and passed . 
Who was this James King of William , so curiously named ? The oldest surviving settler in the Valley of the Moon knows him not . 
Yet only sixty years ago he loaned Mariano G. Vallejo eighteen thousand dollars on security of certain lands including the vineyard yet to be and to be called Tokay . 
He lasts through several pages of this record of the enduring soil . 
There are no names like those to day in the Valley of the Moon . 
The names begin to appear fast and furiously , flashing from legal page to legal page and in a flash vanishing . 
But ever the persistent soil remains for others to scrawl themselves across . 
Come the names of men of whom I have vaguely heard but whom I have never known . 
Kohler and Frohling who built the great stone winery on the vineyard called Tokay , but who built upon a hill up which other vineyardists refused to haul their grapes . 
So Kohler and Frohling lost the land the earthquake of threw down the winery and I now live in its ruins . 
La Motte he broke the soil , planted vines and orchards , instituted commercial fish culture , built a mansion renowned in its day , was defeated by the soil , and passed . 
And my name of a day appears . 
On the site of his orchards and vine yards , of his proud mansion , of his very fish ponds , I have scrawled myself with half a hundred thousand eucalyptus trees . 
Also , Gooper and Greenlaw in their time cleared the virgin forest from three fields of forty acres . 
To day I have those three fields sown with Canada peas , and in the spring they shall be ploughed under for green manure . 
Haska a dim legendary figure of a generation ago , who went back up the mountain and cleared six acres of brush in the tiny valley that took his name . 
He broke the soil , reared stone walls and a house , and planted apple trees . 
So I , too , scratch the land with my brief endeavour and flash my name across a page of legal script ere I pass and the page grows musty . 
Dreamers and ghosts , the White Logic chuckles . 
But surely the striving was not altogether vain , I contend . 
It was based on illusion and is a lie . 
A vital lie , I retort . 
And pray what is a vital lie but a lie ? the White Logic challenges . 
Fill your glass and let us examine these vital liars who crowd your bookshelves . 
Let us dabble in William James a bit . 
A man of health , I say . 
From him we may expect no philosopher's stone , but at least we will find a few robust tonic things to which to tie . 
Rationality gelded to sentiment , the White Logic grins . 
At the end of all his thinking he still clung to the sentiment of immortality . 
Facts transmuted in the alembic of hope into terms of faith . 
The ripest fruit of reason the stultification of reason . 
Is this flesh of yours you ? Or is it an extraneous something possessed by you ? Your body what is it ? A machine for converting stimuli into reactions . 
Stimuli and reactions are remembered . 
Then you are in your consciousness these experiences . 
You are at any moment what you are thinking at that moment . 
Your I is both subject and object it predicates things of itself and is the things predicated . 
The thinker is the thought , the knower is what is known , the possessor is the things possessed . 
But this , man will not accept of himself . 
He refuses to accept his own passing . 
He will live again if he has to die to do it . 
It is nothing new , these vital lies men tell themselves , muttering and mumbling them like charms and incantations against the powers of Night . 
The voodoos and medicine men and the devil devil doctors were the fathers of metaphysics . 
Night and the Noseless One were ogres that beset the way of light and life . 
And the metaphysicians would win by if they had to tell lies to do it . 
They were vexed by the brazen law of the Ecclesiast that men die like the beasts of the field and their end is the same . 
Their creeds were their schemes , their religions their nostrums , their philosophies their devices , by which they half believed they would outwit the Noseless One and the Night . 
Look at them , all the sad wraiths of sad mad men and passionate rebels your Schopenhauers , your Strindbergs , your Tolstois and Nietzsches . 
Accept their bounty while ye may , Before we be accepted by the worms , I will cap you , cries the White Logic . 
No , I answer , while the maggots madden me . 
I know you for what you are , and I am unafraid . 
Under your mask of hedonism you are yourself the Noseless One and your way leads to the Night . 
It , too , is a lie , at best the coward's smug compromise Now will I cap you ! the White Logic breaks in . 
But if you would not this poor life fulfil , Lo , you are free to end it when you will , Without the fear of waking after death . 
And I laugh my defiance for now , and for the moment , I know the White Logic to be the arch impostor of them all , whispering his whispers of death . 
And the dinner gong sounds to the reversed bottom of my glass . 
The clown's the thing ! The clown ! If one must be a philosopher , let him be Aristophanes . 
And no one at the table thinks I am jingled . 
I am in fine fettle , that is all . 
I tire of the labour of thinking , and , when the table is finished , start practical jokes and set all playing at games , which we carry on with bucolic boisterousness . 
To the best of my power I have striven to give the reader a glimpse of a man's secret dwelling when it is shared with John Barleycorn . 
My alcoholic reminiscences draw to a close . 
I survived , through no personal virtue , but because I did not have the chemistry of a dipsomaniac and because I possessed an organism unusually resistant to the ravages of John Barleycorn . 
And , surviving , I have watched the others die , not so lucky , down all the long sad road . 
It was my unmitigated and absolute good fortune , good luck , chance , call it what you will , that brought me through the fires of John Barleycorn . 
My life , my career , my joy in living , have not been destroyed . 
They have been scorched , it is true like the survivors of forlorn hopes , they have by unthinkably miraculous ways come through the fight to marvel at the tally of the slain . 
The way to stop drinking is to stop it . 
The way China stopped the general use of opium was by stopping the cultivation and importation of opium . 
We are so made , that is all . 
We have with great success made a practice of not leaving arsenic and strychnine , and typhoid and tuberculosis germs lying around for our children to be destroyed by . 
Treat John Barleycorn the same way . 
Don't let him lie around , licensed and legal , to pounce upon our youth . 
It is the healthy , normal boys , now born or being born , for whom I write . 
The women are the true conservators of the race . 
The men are the wastrels , the adventure lovers and gamblers , and in the end it is by their women that they are saved . 
About man's first experiment in chemistry was the making of alcohol , and down all the generations to this day man has continued to manufacture and drink it . 
And there has never been a day when the women have not resented man's use of alcohol , though they have never had the power to give weight to their resentment . 
The moment women get the vote in any community , the first thing they proceed to do is to close the saloons . 
In a thousand generations to come men of themselves will not close the saloons . 
As well expect the morphine victims to legislate the sale of morphine out of existence . 
They have paid an incalculable price of sweat and tears for man's use of alcohol . 
And it will be easy . 
The only ones that will be hurt will be the topers and seasoned drinkers of a single generation . 
On the other hand , the overwhelming proportion of young men are so normally non alcoholic , that , never having had access to alcohol , they will never miss it . 
CHAPTER XXXIX Of course , no personal tale is complete without bringing the narrative of the person down to the last moment . 
But mine is no tale of a reformed drunkard . 
I was never a drunkard , and I have not reformed . 
It chanced , some time ago , that I made a voyage of one hundred and forty eight days in a windjammer around the Horn . 
I did not take a drink because I did not desire a drink . 
No one else drank on board . 
The atmosphere for drinking was not present , and in my system there was no organic need for alcohol . 
My chemistry did not demand alcohol . 
I weighed it for five months , in a state of absolute non contact with alcohol . 
And out of the data of past experience , I reached certain conclusions . 
In the first place , I am convinced that not one man in ten thousand or in a hundred thousand is a genuine , chemical dipsomaniac . 
Drinking , as I deem it , is practically entirely a habit of mind . 
It is unlike tobacco , or cocaine , or morphine , or all the rest of the long list of drugs . 
The desire for alcohol is quite peculiarly mental in its origin . 
It is a matter of mental training and growth , and it is cultivated in social soil . 
Not one drinker in a million began drinking alone . 
All drinkers begin socially , and this drinking is accompanied by a thousand social connotations such as I have described out of my own experience in the first part of this narrative . 
These social connotations are the stuff of which the drink habit is largely composed . 
The part that alcohol itself plays is inconsiderable when compared with the part played by the social atmosphere in which it is drunk . 
The human is rarely born these days , who , without long training in the social associations of drinking , feels the irresistible chemical propulsion of his system toward alcohol . 
I do assume that such rare individuals are born , but I have never encountered one . 
On this long , five months' voyage , I found that among all my bodily needs not the slightest shred of a bodily need for alcohol existed . 
But this I did find my need was mental and social . 
When I thought of alcohol , the connotation was fellowship . 
When I thought of fellowship , the connotation was alcohol . 
Fellowship and alcohol were Siamese twins . 
They always occurred linked together . 
Big nights and days and moments , all purple passages and freedoms , thronged my memory . 
Venice stares at me from the printed page , and I remember the cafe tables on the sidewalks . 
The Battle of Santiago , some one says , and I answer , Yes , I've been over the ground . 
But I do not see the ground , nor Kettle Hill , nor the Peace Tree . 
What I see is the Cafe Venus , on the plaza of Santiago , where one hot night I drank and talked with a dying consumptive . 
And so I pondered my problem . 
I should not care to revisit all these fair places of the world except in the fashion I visited them before . 
GLASS IN HAND ! There is a magic in the phrase . 
It means more than all the words in the dictionary can be made to mean . 
It is a habit of mind to which I have been trained all my life . 
It is now part of the stuff that composes me . 
No , I decided I shall take my drink on occasion . 
I would drink but oh , more skilfully , more discreetly , than ever before . 
Never again would I be a peripatetic conflagration . 
Never again would I invoke the White Logic . 
I had learned how not to invoke him . 
The White Logic now lies decently buried alongside the Long Sickness . 
Neither will afflict me again . 
It is many a year since I laid the Long Sickness away his sleep is sound . 
And just as sound is the sleep of the White Logic . 
And yet , in conclusion , I can well say that I wish my forefathers had banished John Barleycorn before my time .
