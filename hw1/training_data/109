And then the madness seized me . 
When I look back over the months I spent at Sunnyside , I wonder that I survived at all . 
As it is , I show the wear and tear of my harrowing experiences . 
I hate to be reminded of unpleasant things and I snapped her off . 
No , I said sharply , I'm not going to use bluing at my time of life , or starch , either . 
Mr. Jamieson , the detective , said himself he could never have done without me , although he gave me little enough credit , in print . 
I shall have to go back several years thirteen , to be exact to start my story . 
At that time my brother died , leaving me his two children . 
Halsey was eleven then , and Gertrude was seven . 
However , I did the best I could . 
When Gertrude got past the hair ribbon age , and Halsey asked for a scarf pin and put on long trousers and a wonderful help that was to the darning . 
I sent them away to good schools . 
I missed the summers with them when , somewhat later , at boarding school and college , the children spent much of their vacations with friends . 
Gradually I found that my name signed to a check was even more welcome than when signed to a letter , though I wrote them at stated intervals . 
But when Halsey had finished his electrical course and Gertrude her boarding school , and both came home to stay , things were suddenly changed . 
Halsey required less personal supervision , and as they both got their mother's fortune that winter , my responsibility became purely moral . 
People are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs . 
The additions to my education made me a properly equipped maiden aunt , and by spring I was quite tractable . 
That was how we went to Sunnyside . 
We went out to inspect the property , and it seemed to deserve its name . 
Its cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of anything out of the ordinary . 
Only one thing seemed unusual to me the housekeeper , who had been left in charge , had moved from the house to the gardener's lodge , a few days before . 
As the lodge was far enough away from the house , it seemed to me that either fire or thieves could complete their work of destruction undisturbed . 
Gertrude and Halsey were infatuated . 
Why , it's everything you want , Halsey said View , air , good water and good roads . 
As for the house , it's big enough for a hospital , if it has a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back , which was ridiculous it was pure Elizabethan . 
Of course we took the place it was not my idea of comfort , being much too large and sufficiently isolated to make the servant question serious . 
But I give myself credit for this whatever has happened since , I never blamed Halsey and Gertrude for taking me there . 
Were I a man I should be a trapper of criminals , trailing them as relentlessly as no doubt my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar . 
But being an unmarried woman , with the handicap of my sex , my first acquaintance with crime will probably be my last . 
Indeed , it came near enough to being my last acquaintance with anything . 
However , the story had had no interest for me . 
I cleared Halsey and Gertrude away to a house party , and moved out to Sunnyside the first of May . 
The roads were bad , but the trees were in leaf , and there were still tulips in the borders around the house . 
The first night passed quietly enough . 
I have always been grateful for that one night's peace it shows what the country might be , under favorable circumstances . 
Never after that night did I put my head on my pillow with any assurance how long it would be there or on my shoulders , for that matter . 
On the following morning Liddy and Mrs. Ralston , my own housekeeper , had a difference of opinion , and Mrs. Ralston left on the eleven train . 
The old man he was white haired and a little stooped , but with an immense idea of his personal dignity gave me his reasons hesitatingly . 
I ain't sayin' nothin' , Mis' Innes , he said , with his hand on the door knob , but there's been goin's on here this las' few months as ain't natchal . 
But I am not easily alarmed . 
It was entirely in vain I represented to Thomas that we were alone , and that he would have to stay in the house that night . 
I stood on the huge veranda and watched him shuffle along down the shadowy drive , with mingled feelings irritation at his cowardice and thankfulness at getting him at all . 
I am not ashamed to say that I double locked the hall door when I went in . 
You can lock up the rest of the house and go to bed , Liddy , I said severely . 
You give me the creeps standing there . 
A woman of your age ought to have better sense . 
It usually braces Liddy to mention her age she owns to forty which is absurd . 
Her mother cooked for my grandfather , and Liddy must be at least as old as I. But that night she refused to brace . 
You're not going to ask me to lock up , Miss Rachel ! she quavered . 
Why , there's a dozen French windows in the drawing room and the billiard room wing , and every one opens on a porch . 
And Mary Anne said that last night there was a man standing by the stable when she locked the kitchen door . 
Mary Anne was a fool , I said sternly . 
Lock up the house and go to bed . 
I am going to read . 
But Liddy set her lips tight and stood still . 
I'm not going to bed , she said . 
I am going to pack up , and to morrow I am going to leave . 
You'll do nothing of the sort , I snapped . 
Liddy and I often desire to part company , but never at the same time . 
If you are afraid , I will go with you , but for goodness' sake don't try to hide behind me . 
The house was a typical summer residence on an extensive scale . 
Wherever possible , on the first floor , the architect had done away with partitions , using arches and columns instead . 
The effect was cool and spacious , but scarcely cozy . 
As Liddy and I went from one window to another , our voices echoed back at us uncomfortably . 
The house was very long , a rectangle in general form , with the main entrance in the center of the long side . 
The brick paved entry opened into a short hall to the right of which , separated only by a row of pillars , was a huge living room . 
Beyond that was the drawing room , and in the end , the billiard room . 
Halsey had pointed it out with delight . 
Just look , Aunt Rachel , he said with a flourish . 
The architect that put up this joint was wise to a few things . 
Arnold Armstrong and his friends could sit here and play cards all night and stumble up to bed in the early morning , without having the family send in a police call . 
Liddy and I got as far as the card room and turned on all the lights . 
I tried the small entry door there , which opened on the veranda , and examined the windows . 
We waited a moment I think Liddy was stunned with fright , or she would have screamed . 
And then I clutched her by the arm and pointed to one of the windows opening on the porch . 
The sudden change threw the window into relief , an oblong of grayish light , and showed us a figure standing close , peering in . 
As I looked it darted across the veranda and out of sight in the darkness . 
CHAPTER II A LINK CUFF BUTTON Liddy's knees seemed to give away under her . 
Without a sound she sank down , leaving me staring at the window in petrified amazement . 
Liddy began to moan under her breath , and in my excitement I reached down and shook her . 
Stop it , I whispered . 
It's only a woman maybe a maid of the Armstrongs' . 
Get up and help me find the door . 
Very well , I said , then I'll have to leave you here . 
She moved at that , and , holding to my sleeve , we felt our way , with numerous collisions , to the billiard room , and from there to the drawing room . 
The lights came on then . 
and , with the long French windows unshuttered , I had a creepy feeling that each one sheltered a peering face . 
In fact , in the light of what happened afterward , I am pretty certain we were under surveillance during the entire ghostly evening . 
We hurried over the rest of the locking up and got upstairs as quickly as we could . 
I left the lights all on , and our footsteps echoed cavernously . 
Liddy had a stiff neck the next morning , from looking back over her shoulder , and she refused to go to bed . 
Let me stay in your dressing room , Miss Rachel , she begged . 
If you don't , I'll sit in the hall outside the door . 
I'm not going to be murdered with my eyes shut . 
If you're going to be murdered , I retorted , it won't make any difference whether they are shut or open . 
But you may stay in the dressing room , if you will lie on the couch when you sleep in a chair you snore . 
She was too far gone to be indignant , but after a while she came to the door and looked in to where I was composing myself for sleep with Drummond's Spiritual Life . 
That wasn't a woman , Miss Rachel , she said , with her shoes in her hand . 
It was a man in a long coat . 
What woman was a man ? I discouraged her without looking up , and she went back to the couch . 
It was eleven o'clock when I finally prepared for bed . 
Then , secure in my precautions , I went to bed . 
I did not go to sleep at once . 
Liddy disturbed me just as I was growing drowsy , by coming in and peering under the bed . 
She was afraid to speak , however , because of her previous snubbing , and went back , stopping in the doorway to sigh dismally . 
Somewhere down stairs a clock with a chime sang away the hours eleven thirty , forty five , twelve . 
And then the lights went out to stay . 
But the lights were gone for good that night . 
Liddy had gone to sleep , as I knew she would . 
She was a very unreliable person always awake and ready to talk when she wasn't wanted and dozing off to sleep when she was . 
I called her once or twice , the only result being an explosive snore that threatened her very windpipe then I got up and lighted a bedroom candle . 
My bedroom and dressing room were above the big living room on the first floor . 
On the second floor a long corridor ran the length of the house , with rooms opening from both sides . 
In the wings were small corridors crossing the main one the plan was simplicity itself . 
It was a rattling metallic sound , and it reverberated along the empty halls like the crash of doom . 
It was for all the world as if something heavy , perhaps a piece of steel , had rolled clattering and jangling down the hard wood stairs leading to the card room . 
In the silence that followed Liddy stirred and snored again . 
I was exasperated first she kept me awake by silly alarms , then when she was needed she slept like Joe Jefferson , or Rip , they are always the same to me . 
I went in and aroused her , and I give her credit for being wide awake the minute I spoke . 
Get up , I said , if you don't want to be murdered in your bed . 
Where ? How ? she yelled vociferously , and jumped up . 
There's somebody in the house , I said . 
We'll have to get to the telephone . 
Not out in the hall ! she gasped Oh , Miss Rachel , not out in the hall ! trying to hold me back . 
But I am a large woman and Liddy is small . 
We got to the door , somehow , and Liddy held a brass andiron , which it was all she could do to lift , let alone brain anybody with . 
I listened , and , hearing nothing , opened the door a little and peered into the hall . 
It was a black void , full of terrible suggestion , and my candle only emphasized the gloom . 
Liddy squealed and drew me back again , and as the door slammed , the mirror I had put on the transom came down and hit her on the head . 
There's going to be a death ! she wailed . 
Oh , Miss Rachel , there's going to be a death ! There will be , I said grimly , if you don't keep quiet , Liddy Allen . 
And so we sat there until morning , wondering if the candle would last until dawn , and arranging what trains we could take back to town . 
The Greenwood Club showed itself a dab of white against the hill across the valley , and an early robin or two hopped around in the dew . 
Not until the milk boy and the sun came , about the same time , did I dare to open the door into the hall and look around . 
Everything was as we had left it . 
Trunks were heaped here and there , ready for the trunk room , and through an end window of stained glass came a streak of red and yellow daylight that was eminently cheerful . 
The milk boy was pounding somewhere below , and the day had begun . 
Thomas Johnson came ambling up the drive about half past six , and we could hear him clattering around on the lower floor , opening shutters . 
I had to take Liddy to her room up stairs , however , she was quite sure she would find something uncanny . 
In fact , when she did not , having now the courage of daylight , she was actually disappointed . 
Well , we did not go back to town that day . 
Allowing for my nerves and the fact that small noises magnify themselves at night , there was still no possibility that the picture had made the series of sounds I heard . 
To prove it , however , I dropped it again . 
It fell with a single muffled crash of its wooden frame , and incidentally ruined itself beyond repair . 
I warned Liddy not to mention what had happened to anybody , and telephoned to town for servants . 
Then after a breakfast which did more credit to Thomas' heart than his head , I went on a short tour of investigation . 
The sounds had come from the east wing , and not without some qualms I began there . 
At first I found nothing . 
Since then I have developed my powers of observation , but at that time I was a novice . 
The small card room seemed undisturbed . 
But the stairs in that wing offered something . 
At the top of the flight had been placed a tall wicker hamper , packed , with linen that had come from town . 
It stood at the edge of the top step , almost barring passage , and on the step below it was a long fresh scratch . 
For three steps the scratch was repeated , gradually diminishing , as if some object had fallen , striking each one . 
Then for four steps nothing . 
On the fifth step below was a round dent in the hard wood . 
That was all , and it seemed little enough , except that I was positive the marks had not been there the day before . 
It bore out my theory of the sound , which had been for all the world like the bumping of a metallic object down a flight of steps . 
The four steps had been skipped . 
Iron bars , however , do not fall down stairs in the middle of the night alone . 
Coupled with the figure on the veranda the agency by which it climbed might be assumed . 
I fixed on an attempt at burglary , as the most natural explanation an attempt frustrated by the falling of the object , whatever it was , that had roused me . 
Under pretext of learning more about the place , Thomas Johnson led me through the house and the cellars , without result . 
Everything was in good order and repair money had been spent lavishly on construction and plumbing . 
The house was full of conveniences , and I had no reason to repent my bargain , save the fact that , in the nature of things , night must come again . 
And other nights must follow and we were a long way from a police station . 
In the afternoon a hack came up from Casanova , with a fresh relay of servants . 
The driver took them with a flourish to the servants' entrance , and drove around to the front of the house , where I was awaiting him . 
Two dollars , he said in reply to my question . 
I don't charge full rates , because , bringin' 'em up all summer as I do , it pays to make a special price . 
When they got off the train , I sez , sez I , There's another bunch for Sunnyside , cook , parlor maid and all . 
Yes'm six summers , and a new lot never less than once a month . 
They won't stand for the country and the lonesomeness , I reckon . 
While I was dressing for dinner , Liddy rapped at the door . 
She was hardly herself yet , but privately I think she was worrying about the broken mirror and its augury , more than anything else . 
When she came in she was holding something in her hand , and she laid it on the dressing table carefully . 
I found it in the linen hamper , she said . 
It must be Mr. Halsey's , but it seems queer how it got there . 
It was the half of a link cuff button of unique design , and I looked at it carefully . 
Where was it ? In the bottom of the hamper ? I asked . 
On the very top , she replied . 
It's a mercy it didn't fall out on the way . 
When Liddy had gone I examined the fragment attentively . 
I had never seen it before , and I was certain it was not Halsey's . 
It was of Italian workmanship , and consisted of a mother of pearl foundation , encrusted with tiny seed pearls , strung on horsehair to hold them . 
In the center was a small ruby . 
The trinket was odd enough , but not intrinsically of great value . 
Its interest for me lay in this Liddy had found it lying in the top of the hamper which had blocked the east wing stairs . 
That afternoon the Armstrongs' housekeeper , a youngish good looking woman , applied for Mrs. Ralston's place , and I was glad enough to take her . 
She looked as though she might be equal to a dozen of Liddy , with her snapping black eyes and heavy jaw . 
Her name was Anne Watson , and I dined that evening for the first time in three days . 
JOHN BAILEY APPEARS I had dinner served in the breakfast room . 
Somehow the huge dining room depressed me , and Thomas , cheerful enough all day , allowed his spirits to go down with the sun . 
He had a habit of watching the corners of the room , left shadowy by the candles on the table , and altogether it was not a festive meal . 
Dinner over I went into the living room . 
I had three hours before the children could possibly arrive , and I got out my knitting . 
I got out the cuff link and went with it to the pantry . 
Thomas was wiping silver and the air was heavy with tobacco smoke . 
I sniffed and looked around , but there was no pipe to be seen . 
Thomas , I said , you have been smoking . 
He was injured innocence itself . 
It's on my coat , ma'm . 
Over at the club the gentlemen But Thomas did not finish . 
The pantry was suddenly filled with the odor of singeing cloth . 
Thomas gave a clutch at his coat , whirled to the sink , filled a tumbler with water and poured it into his right pocket with the celerity of practice . 
Thomas , I said , when he was sheepishly mopping the floor , smoking is a filthy and injurious habit . 
If you must smoke , you must but don't stick a lighted pipe in your pocket again . 
Your skin's your own you can blister it if you like . 
But this house is not mine , and I don't want a conflagration . 
Did you ever see this cuff link before ? No , he never had , he said , but he looked at it oddly . 
I picked it up in the hall , I added indifferently . 
The old man's eyes were shrewd under his bushy eyebrows . 
There's strange goin's on here , Mis' Innes , he said , shaking his head . 
Somethin's goin' to happen , sure . 
You ain't took notice that the big clock in the hall is stopped , I reckon ? Nonsense , I said . 
Clocks have to stop , don't they , if they're not wound ? It's wound up , all right , and it stopped at three o'clock last night , he answered solemnly . 
More'n that , that there clock ain't stopped for fifteen years , not since Mr. Armstrong's first wife died . 
And that ain't all , no MA'M . 
Last three nights I slep' in this place , after the electrics went out I had a token . 
My oil lamp was full of oil , but it kep' goin' out , do what I would . 
Minute I shet my eyes , out that lamp 'd go . 
There ain't no surer token of death . 
The Bible sez , LET YER LIGHT SHINE ! When a hand you can't see puts yer light out , it means death , sure . 
The old man's voice was full of conviction . 
In spite of myself I had a chilly sensation in the small of my back , and I left him mumbling over his dishes . 
Gertrude stood smiling in the hall , with her hat quite over one ear , and her hair in every direction under her pink veil . 
I have brought a guest , Aunt Ray , Halsey said . 
I want you to adopt him into your affections and your Saturday to Monday list . 
Let me present John Bailey , only you must call him Jack . 
In twelve hours he'll be calling you Aunt' I know him . 
We shook hands , and I got a chance to look at Mr. Bailey he was a tall fellow , perhaps thirty , and he wore a small mustache . 
I remember wondering why he seemed to have a good mouth and when he smiled his teeth were above the average . 
One never knows why certain men cling to a messy upper lip that must get into things , any more than one understands some women building up their hair on wire atrocities . 
Otherwise , he was very good to look at , stalwart and tanned , with the direct gaze that I like . 
I am particular about Mr. Bailey , because he was a prominent figure in what happened later . 
Gertrude was tired with the trip and went up to bed very soon . 
I made up my mind to tell them nothing until the next day , and then to make as light of our excitement as possible . 
The two men went to the billiard room , and I could hear them talking as I went up stairs . 
It seemed that Halsey had stopped at the Greenwood Club for gasolene and found Jack Bailey there , with the Sunday golf crowd . 
Mr. Bailey had not been hard to persuade probably Gertrude knew why and they had carried him off triumphantly . 
I roused Liddy to get them something to eat Thomas was beyond reach in the lodge and paid no attention to her evident terror of the kitchen regions . 
Then I went to bed . 
The men were still in the billiard room when I finally dozed off , and the last thing I remember was the howl of a dog in front of the house . 
It wailed a crescendo of woe that trailed off hopefully , only to break out afresh from a new point of the compass . 
At three o'clock in the morning I was roused by a revolver shot . 
The sound seemed to come from just outside my door . 
For a moment I could not move . 
Then I heard Gertrude stirring in her room , and the next moment she had thrown open the connecting door . 
O Aunt Ray ! Aunt Ray ! she cried hysterically . 
Some one has been killed , killed ! Thieves , I said shortly . 
Thank goodness , there are some men in the house to night . 
I was getting into my slippers and a bath robe , and Gertrude with shaking hands was lighting a lamp . 
I was greeted by a series of low screams and questions , and I tried to quiet them . 
Gertrude had dropped on a chair and sat there limp and shivering . 
I went at once across the hall to Halsey's room and knocked then I pushed the door open . 
It was empty the bed had not been occupied ! He must be in Mr. Bailey's room , I said excitedly , and followed by Liddy , we went there . 
Like Halsey's , it had not been occupied ! Gertrude was on her feet now , but she leaned against the door for support . 
They have been killed ! she gasped . 
Then she caught me by the arm and dragged me toward the stairs . 
They may only be hurt , and we must find them , she said , her eyes dilated with excitement . 
I don't remember how we got down the stairs I do remember expecting every moment to be killed . 
The cook was at the telephone up stairs , calling the Greenwood Club , and Liddy was behind me , afraid to come and not daring to stay behind . 
We found the living room and the drawing room undisturbed . 
Gertrude was ahead and in the card room she stopped , holding her candle high . 
Then she pointed silently to the doorway into the hall beyond . 
Huddled there on the floor , face down , with his arms extended , was a man . 
Gertrude ran forward with a gasping sob . 
Jack , she cried , oh , Jack ! Liddy had run , screaming , and the two of us were there alone . 
It was Gertrude who turned him over , finally , until we could see his white face , and then she drew a deep breath and dropped limply to her knees . 
It was the body of a man , a gentleman , in a dinner coat and white waistcoat , stained now with blood the body of a man I had never seen before . 
CHAPTER IV WHERE IS HALSEY ? Gertrude gazed at the face in a kind of g fascination . 
Then she put out her hands blindly , and I thought she was going to faint . 
He has killed him ! she muttered almost inarticulately and at that , because my nerves were going , I gave her a good shake . 
What do you mean ? I said frantically . 
There was a depth of grief and conviction in her tone that was worse than anything she could have said . 
The shake braced her , anyhow , and she seemed to pull herself together . 
Once in the drawing room , Gertrude collapsed and went from one fainting spell into another . 
I had all I could do to keep Liddy from drowning her with cold water , and the maids huddled in a corner , as much use as so many sheep . 
In a short time , although it seemed hours , a car came rushing up , and Anne Watson , who had waited to dress , opened the door . 
Three men from the Greenwood Club , in all kinds of costumes , hurried in . 
I recognized a Mr. Jarvis , but the others were strangers . 
What's wrong ? the Jarvis man asked and we made a strange picture , no doubt . 
Nobody hurt , is there ? He was looking at Gertrude . 
Worse than that , Mr. Jarvis , I said . 
I think it is murder . 
At the word there was a commotion . 
The cook began to cry , and Mrs. Watson knocked over a chair . 
The men were visibly impressed . 
Not any member of the family ? Mr. Jarvis asked , when he had got his breath . 
No , I said and motioning Liddy to look after Gertrude , I led the way with a lamp to the card room door . 
One of the men gave an exclamation , and they all hurried across the room . 
Mr. Jarvis took the lamp from me I remember that and then , feeling myself getting dizzy and light headed , I closed my eyes . 
When I opened them their brief examination was over , and Mr. Jarvis was trying to put me in a chair . 
You must get up stairs , he said firmly , you and Miss Gertrude , too . 
This has been a terrible shock . 
In his own home , too . 
I stared at him without comprehension . 
Who is it ? I asked with difficulty . 
There was a band drawn tight around my throat . 
It is Arnold Armstrong , he said , looking at me oddly , and he has been murdered in his father's house . 
After a minute I gathered myself together and Mr. Jarvis helped me into the living room . 
Liddy had got Gertrude up stairs , and the two strange men from the club stayed with the body . 
The reaction from the shock and strain was tremendous I was collapsed and then Mr. Jarvis asked me a question that brought back my wandering faculties . 
Where is Halsey ? he asked . 
Halsey ! Suddenly Gertrude's stricken face rose before me the empty rooms up stairs . 
Where was Halsey ? He was here , wasn't he ? Mr. Jarvis persisted . 
He stopped at the club on his way over . 
I don't know where he is , I said feebly . 
One of the men from the club came in , asked for the telephone , and I could hear him excitedly talking , saying something about coroners and detectives . 
Mr. Jarvis leaned over to me . 
Why don't you trust me , Miss Innes ? he said . 
If I can do anything I will . 
But tell me the whole thing . 
I did , finally , from the beginning , and when I told of Jack Bailey's being in the house that night , he gave a long whistle . 
I wish they were both here , he said when I finished . 
Whatever mad prank took them away , it would look better if they were here . 
Especially Especially what ? Especially since Jack Bailey and Arnold Armstrong were notoriously bad friends . 
It was Bailey who got Arnold into trouble last spring something about the bank . 
And then , too Go on , I said . 
If there is anything more , I ought to know . 
There's nothing more , he said evasively . 
There's just one thing we may bank on , Miss Innes . 
Any court in the country will acquit a man who kills an intruder in his house , at night . 
If Halsey Why , you don't think Halsey did it ! I exclaimed . 
There was a queer feeling of physical nausea coming over me . 
No , no , not at all , he said with forced cheerfulness . 
Come , Miss Innes , you're a ghost of yourself and I am going to help you up stairs and call your maid . 
This has been too much for you . 
It was early dawn now , and from voices under my window I surmised that Mr. Jarvis and his companions were searching the grounds . 
As for me , I lay in bed , with every faculty awake . 
About six o'clock Gertrude came in . 
She was fully dressed , and I sat up nervously . 
Poor Aunty ! she said . 
What a shocking night you have had ! She came over and sat down on the bed , and I saw she looked very tired and worn . 
Is there anything new ? I asked anxiously . 
The car is gone , but Warner he is the chauffeur Warner is at the lodge and knows nothing about it . 
Well , I said , if I ever get my hands on Halsey Innes , I shall not let go until I have told him a few things . 
When we get this cleared up , I am going back to the city to be quiet . 
One more night like the last two will end me . 
The peace of the country fiddle sticks ! Whereupon I told Gertrude of the noises the night before , and the figure on the veranda in the east wing . 
As an afterthought I brought out the pearl cuff link . 
I have no doubt now , I said , that it was Arnold Armstrong the night before last , too . 
He had a key , no doubt , but why he should steal into his father's house I can not imagine . 
He could have come with my permission , easily enough . 
Anyhow , whoever it was that night , left this little souvenir . 
Gertrude took one look at the cuff link , and went as white as the pearls in it she clutched at the foot of the bed , and stood staring . 
As for me , I was quite as astonished as she was . 
Where did you find it ? she asked finally , with a desperate effort at calm . 
And while I told her she stood looking out of the window with a look I could not fathom on her face . 
It was a relief when Mrs. Watson tapped at the door and brought me some tea and toast . 
The cook was in bed , completely demoralized , she reported , and Liddy , brave with the daylight , was looking for footprints around the house . 
Mrs. Watson herself was a wreck she was blue white around the lips , and she had one hand tied up . 
She said she had fallen down stairs in her excitement . 
It was natural , of course , that the thing would shock her , having been the Armstrongs' housekeeper for several years , and knowing Mr. Arnold well . 
Gertrude had slipped out during my talk with Mrs. Watson , and I dressed and went down stairs . 
The billiard and card rooms were locked until the coroner and the detectives got there , and the men from the club had gone back for more conventional clothing . 
I could hear Thomas in the pantry , alternately wailing for Mr. Arnold , as he called him , and citing the tokens that had precursed the murder . 
The house seemed to choke me , and , slipping a shawl around me , I went out on the drive . 
At the corner by the east wing I met Liddy . 
Her skirts were draggled with dew to her knees , and her hair was still in crimps . 
Go right in and change your clothes , I said sharply . 
You're a sight , and at your age ! She had a golf stick in her hand , and she said she had found it on the lawn . 
I took it from her , and sent her up for dry garments . 
Her daylight courage and self importance , and her shuddering delight in the mystery , irritated me beyond words . 
After I left her I made a circuit of the building . 
Nothing seemed to be disturbed the house looked as calm and peaceful in the morning sun as it had the day I had been coerced into taking it . 
There was nothing to show that inside had been mystery and violence and sudden death . 
In one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird was pecking viciously at something that glittered in the light . 
Not until I had got into my bedroom and double locked the door did I venture to take it out and examine it . 
One look was all I needed . 
I had unpacked it the day before and put it on his shaving stand , and there could be no mistake . 
His name was on a small silver plate on the handle . 
I seemed to see a network closing around my boy , innocent as I knew he was . 
The revolver I am afraid of them , but anxiety gave me courage to look through the barrel the revolver had still two bullets in it . 
I could only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that I had found the revolver before any sharp eyed detective had come around . 
I decided to keep what clues I had , the cuff link , the golf stick and the revolver , in a secure place until I could see some reason for displaying them . 
The cuff link had been dropped into a little filigree box on my toilet table . 
I opened the box and felt around for it . 
The box was empty the cuff link had disappeared ! CHAPTER V GERTRUDE'S ENGAGEMENT At ten o'clock the Casanova hack brought up three men . 
They introduced themselves as the coroner of the county and two detectives from the city . 
The coroner led the way at once to the locked wing , and with the aid of one of the detectives examined the rooms and the body . 
The other detective , after a short scrutiny of the dead man , busied himself with the outside of the house . 
It was only after they had got a fair idea of things as they were that they sent for me . 
I received them in the living room , and I had made up my mind exactly what to tell . 
I had taken the house for the summer , I said , while the Armstrongs were in California . 
In spite of a rumor among the servants about strange noises I cited Thomas nothing had occurred the first two nights . 
On the third night I believed that some one had been m the house I had heard a crashing sound , but being alone with one maid had not investigated . 
The house had been locked in the morning and apparently undisturbed . 
I should have been glad to allow him entree there at any time . 
Your theory is that Mr. Armstrong was followed here by some enemy , and shot as he entered the house ? I don't think I have a theory , I said . 
The coroner was a very silent man he took some notes after this , but he seemed anxious to make the next train back to town . 
I was just beginning to breathe freely when Mr. Jamieson , who had been standing by the window , came over to me . 
The family consists of yourself alone , Miss Innes ? My niece is here , I said . 
There is no one but yourself and your niece ? My nephew . 
I had to moisten my lips . 
I should like to see him , if he is here . 
He is not here just now , I said as quietly as I could . 
I expect him at any time . 
He was here yesterday evening , I believe ? No yes . 
Didn't he have a guest with him ? Another man ? He brought a friend with him to stay over Sunday , Mr. Bailey . 
Mr. John Bailey , the cashier of the Traders' Bank I believe . 
And I knew that some one at the Greenwood Club had told . 
When did they leave ? Very early I don't know at just what time . 
Mr. Jamieson turned suddenly and looked at me . 
Please try to be more explicit , he said . 
You say your nephew and Mr. Bailey were in the house last night , and yet you and your niece , with some women servants , found the body . 
Where was your nephew ? I was entirely desperate by that time . 
I do not know , I cried , but be sure of this Halsey knows nothing of this thing , and no amount of circumstantial evidence can make an innocent man guilty . 
Sit down , he said , pushing forward a chair . 
There are some things I have to tell you , and , in return , please tell me all you know . 
Believe me , things always come out . 
In the first place , Mr. Armstrong was shot from above . 
The bullet was fired at close range , entered below the shoulder and came out , after passing through the heart , well down the back . 
In other words , I believe the murderer stood on the stairs and fired down . 
Neither one had been more than lighted , then put down and forgotten . 
I sincerely hope so , he said . 
Miss Innes , has it occurred to you that Mr. Bailey might know something of this ? Gertrude had come down stairs and just as he spoke she came in . 
I saw her stop suddenly , as if she had been struck . 
He does not , she said in a tone that was not her own . 
Mr. Bailey and my brother know nothing of this . 
The murder was committed at three . 
They left the house at a quarter before three . 
How do you know that ? Mr. Jamieson asked oddly . 
Do you KNOW at what time they left ? I do , Gertrude answered firmly . 
At a quarter before three my brother and Mr. Bailey left the house , by the main entrance . 
Gertrude , I said excitedly , you are dreaming ! Why , at a quarter to three Listen , she said . 
At half past two the downstairs telephone rang . 
I had not gone to sleep , and I heard it . 
Then I heard Halsey answer it , and in a few minutes he came up stairs and knocked at my door . 
We we talked for a minute , then I put on my dressing gown and slippers , and went down stairs with him . 
Mr. Bailey was in the billiard room . 
We we all talked together for perhaps ten minutes . 
Then it was decided that that they should both go away Can't you be more explicit ? Mr. Jamieson asked . 
WHY did they go away ? I am only telling you what happened , not why it happened , she said evenly . 
Halsey went for the car , and instead of bringing it to the house and rousing people , he went by the lower road from the stable . 
Mr. Bailey was to meet him at the foot of the lawn . 
Mr. Bailey left Which way ? Mr. Jamieson asked sharply . 
He left it was a quarter to three . 
The clock in the hall is stopped , Miss Innes , said Jamieson . 
Nothing seemed to escape him . 
He looked at his watch , she replied , and I could see Mr. Jamieson's snap , as if he had made a discovery . 
As for myself , during the whole recital I had been plunged into the deepest amazement . 
Will you pardon me for a personal question ? The detective was a youngish man , and I thought he was somewhat embarrassed . 
What are your your relations with Mr. Bailey ? Gertrude hesitated . 
Then she came over and put her hand lovingly in mine . 
I am engaged to marry him , she said simply . 
I had grown so accustomed to surprises that I could only gasp again , and as for Gertrude , the hand that lay in mine was burning with fever . 
And after that , Mr. Jamieson went on , you went directly to bed ? Gertrude hesitated . 
No , she said finally . 
Will you tell me what it was you had forgotten ? I can not tell you , she said slowly . 
I I did not leave the billiard room at once Why ? The detective's tone was imperative . 
This is very important , Miss Innes . 
I was crying , Gertrude said in a low tone . 
When the French clock in the drawing room struck three , I got up , and then I heard a step on the east porch , just outside the card room . 
Some one with a key was working with the latch , and I thought , of course , of Halsey . 
When we took the house he called that his entrance , and he had carried a key for it ever since . 
The door opened and I was about to ask what he had forgotten , when there was a flash and a report . 
Some heavy body dropped , and , half crazed with terror and shock , I ran through the drawing room and got up stairs I scarcely remember how . 
She dropped into a chair , and I thought Mr. Jamieson must have finished . 
But he was not through . 
You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Bailey admirably , he said . 
The testimony is invaluable , especially in view of the fact that your brother and Mr. Armstrong had , I believe , quarreled rather seriously some time ago . 
Nonsense , I broke in . 
Things are bad enough , Mr. Jamieson , without inventing bad feeling where it doesn't exist . 
Gertrude , I don't think Halsey knew the the murdered man , did he ? But Mr. Jamieson was sure of his ground . 
The quarrel , I believe , he persisted , was about Mr. Armstrong's conduct to you , Miss Gertrude . 
He had been paying you unwelcome attentions . 
And I had never seen the man ! When she nodded a yes I saw the tremendous possibilities involved . 
The prominence of the family assured a strenuous effort to find the murderer , and if we had nothing worse to look forward to , we were sure of a distasteful publicity . 
Mr. Jamieson shut his note book with a snap , and thanked us . 
I have an idea , he said , apropos of nothing at all , that at any rate the ghost is laid here . 
Whatever the rappings have been and the colored man says they began when the family went west three months ago they are likely to stop now . 
Which shows how much he knew about it . 
The ghost was not laid with the murder of Arnold Armstrong he , or it , only seemed to take on fresh vigor . 
Mr. Jamieson left then , and when Gertrude had gone up stairs , as she did at once , I sat and thought over what I had just heard . 
Her engagement , once so engrossing a matter , paled now beside the significance of her story . 
The Greenwood Club promised the same thing , and as there are no Sunday afternoon papers , the murder was not publicly known until Monday . 
The coroner himself notified the Armstrong family lawyer , and early in the afternoon he came out . 
I had not seen Mr. Jamieson since morning , but I knew he had been interrogating the servants . 
Gertrude was locked in her room with a headache , and I had luncheon alone . 
Mr. Harton , the lawyer , was a little , thin man , and he looked as if he did not relish his business that day . 
This is very unfortunate , Miss Innes , he said , after we had shaken hands . 
With the father and mother in the west , I find everything devolves on me and , as you can understand , it is an unpleasant duty . 
No doubt , I said absently . 
Mr. Harton , I am going to ask you some questions , and I hope you will answer them . 
I feel that I am entitled to some knowledge , because I and my family are just now in a most ambiguous position . 
I don't know whether he understood me or not he took of his glasses and wiped them . 
I shall be very happy , he said with old fashioned courtesy . 
Mr. Harton , did Mr. Arnold Armstrong know that Sunnyside had been rented ? I think yes , he did . 
In fact , I myself told him about it . 
And he knew who the tenants were ? Yes . 
He had not been living with the family for some years , I believe ? No. Unfortunately , there had been trouble between Arnold and his father . 
For two years he had lived in town . 
Then it would be unlikely that he came here last night to get possession of anything belonging to him ? I should think it hardly possible , he admitted . 
To be perfectly frank , Miss Innes , I can not think of any reason whatever for his coming here as he did . 
He had been staying at the club house across the valley for the last week , Jarvis tells me , but that only explains how he came here , not why . 
It is a most unfortunate family . 
He shook his head despondently , and I felt that this dried up little man was the repository of much that he had not told me . 
I gave up trying to elicit any information from him , and we went together to view the body before it was taken to the city . 
It had been lifted on to the billiard table and a sheet thrown over it otherwise nothing had been touched . 
A soft hat lay beside it , and the collar of the dinner coat was still turned up . 
The handsome , dissipated face of Arnold Armstrong , purged of its ugly lines , was now only pathetic . 
As we went in Mrs. Watson appeared at the card room door . 
Come in , Mrs. Watson , the lawyer said . 
But she shook her head and withdrew she was the only one in the house who seemed to regret the dead man , and even she seemed rather shocked than sorry . 
I went to the door at the foot of the circular staircase and opened it . 
But there was nothing to be seen . 
When I went back , Mr. Harton was furtively wiping his eyes . 
The prodigal has come home , Miss Innes , he said . 
How often the sins of the fathers are visited on the children ! Which left me pondering . 
Before Mr. Harton left , he told me something of the Armstrong family . 
Paul Armstrong , the father , had been married twice . 
Arnold was a son by the first marriage . 
The second Mrs. Armstrong had been a widow , with a child , a little girl . 
This child , now perhaps twenty , was Louise Armstrong , having taken her stepfather's name , and was at present in California with the family . 
They will probably return at once , he concluded sad part of my errand here to day is to see if you will relinquish your lease here in their favor . 
We would better wait and see if they wish to come , I said . 
It seems unlikely , and my town house is being remodeled . 
At that he let the matter drop , but it came up unpleasantly enough , later . 
At six o'clock the body was taken away , and at seven thirty , after an early dinner , Mr. Harton went . 
Gertrude had not come down , and there was no news of Halsey . 
Mr. Jamieson had taken a lodging in the village , and I had not seen him since mid afternoon . 
It was about nine o'clock , I think , when the bell rang and he was ushered into the living room . 
Sit down , I said grimly . 
Have you found a clue that will incriminate me , Mr. Jamieson ? He had the grace to look uncomfortable . 
If you had killed Mr. Armstrong , you would have left no clues . 
You would have had too much intelligence . 
After that we got along better . 
He was fishing in his pocket , and after a minute he brought out two scraps of paper . 
I have been to the club house , he said , and among Mr. Armstrong's effects , I found these . 
One is curious the other is puzzling . 
The first was a sheet of club note paper , on which was written , over and over , the name Halsey B. Innes . 
It was Halsey's flowing signature to a dot , but it lacked Halsey's ease . 
The ones toward the bottom of the sheet were much better than the top ones . 
Mr. Jamieson smiled at my face . 
His old tricks , he said . 
That one is merely curious this one , as I said before , is puzzling . 
by altering the plans for rooms , may be possible . 
The best way , in my opinion , would be to the plan for in one of the rooms chimney . 
Well ? I said , looking up . 
There is nothing in that , is there ? A man ought to be able to change the plan of his house without becoming an object of suspicion . 
If it is this house , it may mean anything , from a secret room To an extra bath room , I said scornfully . 
The oddest part is , Miss Innes , that the thumb mark is probably yours and the footprint certainly . 
His audacity was the only thing that saved me his amused smile put me on my mettle , and I ripped out a perfectly good scallop before I answered . 
Why did I step into the tulip bed ? I asked with interest . 
You picked up something , he said good humoredly , which you are going to tell me about later . 
Am I , indeed ? I was politely curious . 
With this remarkable insight of yours , I wish you would tell me where I shall find my four thousand dollar motor car . 
I was just coming to that , he said . 
You will find it about thirty miles away , at Andrews Station , in a blacksmith shop , where it is being repaired . 
I laid down my knitting then and looked at him . 
And Halsey ? I managed to say . 
We are going to exchange information , he said I am going to tell you that , when you tell me what you picked up in the tulip bed . 
We looked steadily at each other it was not an unfriendly stare we were only measuring weapons . 
Then he smiled a little and got up . 
With your permission , he said , I am going to examine the card room and the staircase again . 
You might think over my offer in the meantime . 
He went on through the drawing room , and I listened to his footsteps growing gradually fainter . 
I dropped my pretense at knitting and , leaning back , I thought over the last forty eight hours . 
I was roused by hearing Mr. Jamieson coming rapidly back through the drawing room . 
He stopped at the door . 
I jumped ! up at once . 
You mean the murderer ? I gasped . 
Possibly , he said quietly , as we hurried together up the stairs . 
Some one was lurking on the staircase when I went back . 
I spoke instead of an answer , whoever it was turned and ran up . 
I followed it was dark but as I turned the corner at the top a figure darted through this door and closed it . 
The bolt was on my side , and I pushed it forward . 
It is a closet , I think . 
We were in the upper hall now . 
If you will show me the electric switch , Miss Innes , you would better wait in your own room . 
Trembling as I was , I was determined to see that door opened . 
I hardly knew what I feared , but so many terrible and inexplicable things had happened that suspense was worse than certainty . 
I am perfectly cool , I said , and I am going to remain here . 
The lights flashed up along that end of the corridor , throwing the doors into relief . 
At the intersection of the small hallway with the larger , the circular staircase wound its way up , as if it had been an afterthought of the architect . 
And just around the corner , in the small corridor , was the door Mr. Jamieson had indicated . 
I was still unfamiliar with the house , and I did not remember the door . 
My heart was thumping wildly in my ears , but I nodded to him to go ahead . 
I was perhaps eight or ten feet away and then he threw the bolt back . 
Come out , he said quietly . 
Come out , he repeated . 
Then I think he had a revolver , but I am not sure he stepped aside and threw the door open . 
When my knees had stopped shaking , I moved forward , slowly , nervously , until I had a partial view of what was beyond the door . 
It seemed at first to be a closet , empty . 
Then I went close and examined it , to stop with a shudder . 
Where the floor should have been was black void and darkness , from which came the indescribable , damp smell of the cellars . 
Mr , Jamieson had locked somebody in the clothes chute . 
As I leaned over I fancied I heard a groan or was it the wind ? CHAPTER VII A SPRAINED ANKLE I was panic stricken . 
As I ran along the corridor I was confident that the mysterious intruder and probable murderer had been found , and that he lay dead or dying at the foot of the chute . 
I got down the staircase somehow , and through the kitchen to the basement stairs . 
Mr. Jamieson had been before me , and the door stood open . 
Liddy was standing in the middle of the kitchen , holding a frying pan by the handle as a weapon . 
Don't go down there , she yelled , when she saw me moving toward the basement stairs . 
Don't you do it , Miss Rachel . 
That Jamieson's down there now . 
There's only trouble comes of hunting ghosts they lead you into bottomless pits and things like that . 
Oh , Miss Rachel , don't as I tried to get past her . 
She was interrupted by Mr. Jamieson's reappearance . 
He ran up the stairs two at a time , and his face was flushed and furious . 
The whole place is locked , he said angrily . 
where's the laundry key kept ? It's kept in the door , Liddy snapped . 
Liddy , I said sharply , come down with us and turn on all the lights . 
She offered her resignation , as usual , on the spot , but I took her by the arm , and she came along finally . 
She switched on all the lights and pointed to a door just ahead . 
That's the door , she said sulkily . 
But the key was not in it . 
Mr. Jamieson shook it , but it was a heavy door , well locked . 
And then he stooped and began punching around the keyhole with the end of a lead pencil . 
When he stood up his face was exultant . 
It's locked on the inside , he said in a low tone . 
There is somebody in there . 
Lord have mercy ! gasped Liddy , and turned to run . 
Liddy , I called , go through the house at once and see who is missing , or if any one is . 
We'll have to clear this thing at once . 
Mr. Jamieson , if you will watch here I will go to the lodge and find Warner . 
Thomas would be of no use . 
Together you may be able to force the door . 
A good idea , he assented . 
But there are windows , of course , and there is nothing to prevent whoever is in there from getting out that way . 
Then lock the door at the top of the basement stairs , I suggested , and patrol the house from the outside . 
We agreed to this , and I had a feeling that the mystery of Sunnyside was about to be solved . 
I ran down the steps and along the drive . 
Just at the corner I ran full tilt into somebody who seemed to be as much alarmed as I was . 
It was not until I had recoiled a step or two that I recognized Gertrude , and she me . 
Good gracious , Aunt Ray , she exclaimed , what is the matter ? There's somebody locked in the laundry , I panted . 
That is unless you didn't see any one crossing the lawn or skulking around the house , did you ? I think we have mystery on the brain , Gertrude said wearily . 
No , I haven't seen any one , except old Thomas , who looked for all the world as if he had been ransacking the pantry . 
What have you locked in the laundry ? I can't wait to explain , I replied . 
I must get Warner from the lodge . 
If you came out for air , you'd better put on your overshoes . 
And then I noticed that Gertrude was limping not much , but sufficiently to make her progress very slow , and seemingly painful . 
You have hurt yourself , I said sharply . 
I fell over the carriage block , she explained . 
I thought perhaps I might see Halsey coming home . 
He he ought to be here . 
I hurried on down the drive . 
The lodge was some distance from the house , in a grove of trees where the drive met the county road . 
There were two white stone pillars to mark the entrance , but the iron gates , once closed and tended by the lodge keeper , now stood permanently open . 
The day of the motor car had come no one had time for closed gates and lodge keepers . 
The lodge at Sunnyside was merely a sort of supplementary servants' quarters it was as convenient in its appointments as the big house and infinitely more cozy . 
As I went down the drive , my thoughts were busy . 
Who would it be that Mr. Jamieson had trapped in the cellar ? Would we find a body or some one badly injured ? Scarcely either . 
Whoever had fallen had been able to lock the laundry door on the inside . 
If Gertrude had been on the circular staircase that night , why had she fled from Mr. Jamieson ? The idea , puzzling as it was , seemed borne out by this circumstance . 
Whoever had taken refuge at the head of the stairs could scarcely have been familiar with the house , or with the location of the chute . 
The mystery seemed to deepen constantly . 
At the foot of the drive the road described a long , sloping , horseshoe shaped curve around the lodge . 
There were lights there , streaming cheerfully out on to the trees , and from an upper room came wavering shadows , as if some one with a lamp was moving around . 
I had come almost silently in my evening slippers , and I had my second collision of the evening on the road just above the house . 
I ran full into a man in a long coat , who was standing in the shadow beside the drive , with his back to me , watching the lighted windows . 
What the hell ! he ejaculated furiously , and turned around . 
When he saw me , however , he did not wait for any retort on my part . 
He faded away this is not slang he did he absolutely disappeared in the dusk without my getting more than a glimpse of his face . 
I had a vague impression of unfamiliar features and of a sort of cap with a visor . 
I went to the lodge and rapped . 
It required two or three poundings to bring Thomas to the door , and he opened it only an inch or so . 
Where is Warner ? I asked . 
I I think he's in bed , ma'm . 
Get him up , I said , and for goodness' sake open the door , Thomas . 
It's kind o' close in here , ma'm , he said , obeying gingerly , and disclosing a cool and comfortable looking interior . 
Perhaps you'd keer to set on the porch an' rest yo'self . 
It was so evident that Thomas did not want me inside that I went in . 
Tell Warner he is needed in a hurry , I repeated , and turned into the little sitting room . 
I could hear Thomas going up the stairs , could hear him rouse Warner , and the steps of the chauffeur as he hurriedly dressed . 
But my attention was busy with the room below . 
On the center table , open , was a sealskin traveling bag . 
It was filled with gold topped bottles and brushes , and it breathed opulence , luxury , femininity from every inch of surface . 
How did it get there ? I was still asking myself the question when Warner came running down the stairs and into the room . 
He was completely but somewhat incongruously dressed , and his open , boyish face looked abashed . 
What is it , Miss Innes ? he asked anxiously . 
There is some one locked in the laundry , I replied . 
Mr. Jamieson wants you to help him break the lock . 
Warner , whose bag is this ? He was in the doorway by this time , and he pretended not to hear . 
Warner , I called , come back here . 
Whose bag is this ? He stopped then , but he did not turn around . 
It's it belongs to Thomas , he said , and fled up the drive . 
Did you see if there was any one missing in the house ? I asked , ignoring the array of sauce pans rolling pins , and the poker of the range . 
Rosie is missing , Liddy said with unction . 
She had objected to Rosie , the parlor maid , from the start . 
Mrs. Watson went into her room , and found she had gone without her hat . 
After which carefully veiled sarcasm Liddy relapsed into gloom . 
Warner came in then with a handful of small tools , and Mr. Jamieson went with him to the basement . 
Oddly enough , I was not alarmed . 
With all my heart I wished for Halsey , but I was not frightened . 
At the door he was to force , Warner put down his tools and looked at it . 
Then he turned the handle . 
Without the slightest difficulty the door opened , revealing the blackness of the drying room beyond ! Mr. Jamieson gave an exclamation of disgust . 
Confound such careless work ! I might have known . 
We got the lights on finally and looked all through the three rooms that constituted this wing of the basement . 
Everything was quiet and empty . 
An explanation of how the fugitive had escaped injury was found in a heaped up basket of clothes under the chute . 
The basket had been overturned , but that was all . 
Mr. Jamieson examined the windows one was unlocked , and offered an easy escape . 
The window or the door ? Which way had the fugitive escaped ? The door seemed most probable , and I hoped it had been so . 
I went up stairs at last , tired and depressed . 
Mrs. Watson and Liddy were making tea in the kitchen . 
Mrs. Watson was fixing a tray to be sent in to me , and when I asked her about Rosie she confirmed her absence . 
She's not here , she said but I would not think much of that , Miss Innes . 
Rosie is a pretty young girl , and perhaps she has a sweetheart . 
It will be a good thing if she has . 
The maids stay much better when they have something like that to hold them here . 
Gertrude had gone back to her room , and while I was drinking my cup of hot tea , Mr. Jamieson came in . 
We might take up the conversation where we left off an hour and a half ago , he said . 
But before we go on , I want to say this The person who escaped from the laundry was a woman with a foot of moderate size and well arched . 
She wore nothing but a stocking on her right foot , and , in spite of the unlocked door , she escaped by the window . 
And again I thought of Gertrude's sprained ankle . 
And yet your maid affirms with equal positiveness that it was a man . 
Nonsense , I broke in . 
Liddy had her eyes shut she always shuts them when she's frightened . 
Now we are getting down to business . 
WHAT were your reasons for thinking that ? I hesitated . 
If you have any reason for believing that your midnight guest was Mr. Armstrong , other than his visit here the next night , you ought to tell me , Miss Innes . 
We can take nothing for granted . 
And then , because I could think of no other reason for my statement , I told him about the pearl cuff link . 
Will you give me the link , he said , when I finished , or , at least , let me see it ? I consider it a most important clue . 
Won't the description do ? Not as well as the original . 
Well , I'm very sorry , I said , as calmly as I could , I the thing is lost . 
It it must have fallen out of a box on my dressing table . 
Whatever he thought of my explanation , and I knew he doubted it , he made no sign . 
He asked me to describe the link accurately , and I did so , while he glanced at a list he took from his pocket . 
One set monogram cuff links , he read , one set plain pearl links , one set cuff links , woman's head set with diamonds and emeralds . 
The idea was new to me . 
Miss Gertrude Innes testified that she heard some one fumbling with the lock , that the door opened , and that almost immediately the shot was fired . 
Now , Miss Innes , here is the strange part of that . 
Mr. Armstrong had no key with him . 
There was no key in the lock , or on the floor . 
In other words , the evidence points absolutely to this Mr. Armstrong was admitted to the house from within . 
It is impossible , I broke in . 
In fact , Miss Innes , I am quite certain she did not . 
I know Miss Gertrude went back to the billiard room to get something , she refuses to say what . 
You suspect what happened to the cuff link , but you won't tell me . 
Who knows it may have been Liddy ! I stirred my tea angrily . 
I have always heard , I said dryly , that undertakers' assistants are jovial young men . 
A man's sense of humor seems to be in inverse proportion to the gravity of his profession . 
A man's sense of humor is a barbarous and a cruel thing , Miss Innes , he admitted . 
It is to the feminine as the hug of a bear is to the scratch of well anything with claws . 
Is that you , Thomas ? Come in . 
Thomas Johnson stood in the doorway . 
He looked alarmed and apprehensive , and suddenly I remembered the sealskin dressing bag in the lodge . 
Thomas came just inside the door and stood with his head drooping , his eyes , under their shaggy gray brows , fixed on Mr. Jamieson . 
You came here Friday night to see Miss Innes , didn't you ? And came to work here Saturday morning ? For some unexplained reason Thomas looked relieved . 
Yas , sah , he said . 
You see it were like this When Mistah Armstrong and the fam'ly went away , Mis' Watson an' me , we was lef' in charge till the place was rented . 
Mis' Watson , she've bin here a good while , an' she warn' skeery . 
So she slep' in the house . 
I'd bin havin' tokens I tol' Mis' Innes some of 'em an' I slep' in the lodge . 
Then one day Mis' Watson , she came to me an' she sez , sez she , 'Thomas , you'll hev to sleep up in the big house . 
I'm too nervous to do it any more . 
But I jes' reckon to myself that ef it's too skeery fer her , it's too skeery fer me . 
We had it , then , sho' nuff , and it ended up with Mis' Watson stayin' in the lodge nights an' me lookin' fer work at de club . 
Did Mrs. Watson say that anything had happened to alarm her ? No , sah . 
She was jes' natchally skeered . 
Well , that was all , far's I know , until the night I come over to see Mis' Innes . 
I come across the valley , along the path from the club house , and I goes home that way . 
Down in the creek bottom I almost run into a man . 
He wuz standin' with his back to me , an' he was workin' with one of these yere electric light things that fit in yer pocket . 
He was havin' trouble one minute it'd flash out , an' the nex' it'd be gone . 
I hed a view of 'is white dress shirt an' tie , as I passed . 
I didn't see his face . 
But I know it warn't Mr. Arnold . 
It was a taller man than Mr. Arnold . 
Beside that , Mr. Arnold was playin' cards when I got to the club house , same's he'd been doin' all day . 
And the next morning you came back along the path , pursued Mr. Jamieson relentlessly . 
The nex' mornin' I come back along the path an' down where I dun see the man night befoh , I picked up this here . 
The old man held out a tiny object and Mr. Jamieson took it . 
Then he held it on his extended palm for me to see . 
It was the other half of the pearl cuff link ! But Mr. Jamieson was not quite through questioning him . 
I'll keep this link , Thomas , for a while , the detective said . 
That's all I wanted to know . 
As Thomas shuffled out , Mr. Jamieson watched me sharply . 
You see , Miss Innes , he said , Mr. Bailey insists on mixing himself with this thing . 
There could be motive proved , I think . 
Arnold Armstrong and John Bailey have been enemies since the latter , as cashier of the Traders' Bank , brought Arnold almost into the clutches of the law . 
Also , you forget that both men have been paying attention to Miss Gertrude . 
Bailey's flight looks bad , too . 
And you think Halsey helped him to escape ? Undoubtedly . 
Why , what could it be but flight ? Miss Innes , let me reconstruct that evening , as I see it . 
Bailey and Armstrong had quarreled at the club . 
I learned this to day . 
Your nephew brought Bailey over . 
Prompted by jealous , insane fury , Armstrong followed , coming across by the path . 
He entered the billiard room wing perhaps rapping , and being admitted by your nephew . 
Just inside he was shot , by some one on the circular staircase . 
The shot fired , your nephew and Bailey left the house at once , going toward the automobile house . 
They left by the lower road , which prevented them being heard , and when you and Miss Gertrude got down stairs everything was quiet . 
But Gertrude's story , I stammered . 
Miss Gertrude only brought forward her explanation the following morning . 
I do not believe it , Miss Innes . 
It is the story of a loving and ingenious woman . 
And this thing to night ? May upset my whole view of the case . 
We must give the benefit of every doubt , after all . 
We may , for instance , come back to the figure on the porch if it was a woman you saw that night through the window , we might start with other premises . 
Or Mr. Innes' explanation may turn us in a new direction . 
It is possible that he shot Arnold Armstrong as a burglar and then fled , frightened at what he had done . 
In any case , however , I feel confident that the body was here when he left . 
Mr. Armstrong left the club ostensibly for a moonlight saunter , about half after eleven o'clock . 
It was three when the shot was fired . 
It seemed to me that the evening had been full of significant happenings , had I only held the key . 
I went with him to the door , and together we stood looking out over the valley . 
Below lay the village of Casanova , with its Old World houses , its blossoming trees and its peace . 
Above on the hill across the valley were the lights of the Greenwood Club . 
It was even possible to see the curving row of parallel lights that marked the carriage road . 
Rumors that I had heard about the club came back of drinking , of high play , and once , a year ago , of a suicide under those very lights . 
Mr. Jamieson left , taking a short cut to the village , and I still stood there . 
It must have been after eleven , and the monotonous tick of the big clock on the stairs behind me was the only sound . 
Then I was conscious that some one was running up the drive . 
In a minute a woman darted into the area of light made by the open door , and caught me by the arm . 
It was Rosie Rosie in a state of collapse from terror , and , not the least important , clutching one of my Coalport plates and a silver spoon . 
She stood staring into the darkness behind , still holding the plate . 
I got her into the house and secured the plate then I stood and looked down at her where she crouched tremblingly against the doorway . 
Well , I asked , didn't your young man enjoy his meal ? She couldn't speak . 
She looked at the spoon she still held I wasn't so anxious about it thank Heaven , it wouldn't chip and then she stared at me . 
I appreciate your desire to have everything nice for him , I went on , but the next time , you might take the Limoges china It's more easily duplicated and less expensive . 
I haven't a young man not here . 
She had got her breath now , as I had guessed she would . 
I I have been chased by a thief , Miss Innes . 
Did he chase you out of the house and back again ? I asked . 
Then Rosie began to cry not silently , but noisily , hysterically . 
I stopped her by giving her a good shake . 
What in the world is the matter with you ? I snapped . 
Has the day of good common sense gone by ! Sit up and tell me the whole thing . 
Rosie sat up then , and sniffled . 
I was coming up the drive she began . 
You must start with when you went DOWN the drive , with my dishes and my silver , I interrupted , but , seeing more signs of hysteria , I gave in . 
You were coming up the drive I had a basket of of silver and dishes on my arm and I was carrying the plate , because because I was afraid I'd break it . 
Part way up the road a man stepped out of the bushes , and held his arm like this , spread out , so I couldn't get past . 
He said he said Not so fast , young lady I want you to let me see what's in that basket . 
She got up in her excitement and took hold of my arm . 
It was like this , Miss Innes , she said , and say you was the man . 
When he said that , I screamed and ducked under his arm like this . 
He caught at the basket and I dropped it . 
I ran as fast as I could , and he came after as far as the trees . 
Oh , Miss Innes , it must have been the man that killed that Mr. Armstrong ! Don't be foolish , I said . 
Whoever killed Mr. Armstrong would put as much space between himself and this house as he could . 
I listened to Rosie as she went up stairs , running past the shadowy places and slamming her door . 
Then I sat down and looked at the Coalport plate and the silver spoon . 
I had brought my own china and silver , and , from all appearances , I would have little enough to take back . 
But though I might jeer at Rosie as much as I wished , the fact remained that some one had been on the drive that night who had no business there . 
Although neither had Rosie , for that matter . 
I could fancy Liddy's face when she missed the extra pieces of china she had opposed Rosie from the start . 
If Liddy once finds a prophecy fulfilled , especially an unpleasant one , she never allows me to forget it . 
As the door closed behind me I half regretted my impulse then I shut my teeth and went on . 
I have never been a nervous woman , as I said before . 
Moreover , a minute or two in the darkness enabled me to see things fairly well . 
Beulah gave me rather a start by rubbing unexpectedly against my feet then we two , side by side , went down the drive . 
There were no fragments of china , but where the grove began I picked up a silver spoon . 
Then I saw something gleaming , which proved to be the handle of a cup , and a step or two farther on I found a V shaped bit of a plate . 
Then Rosie's story was true . 
As it came closer I recognized the outline of the Dragon Fly , and knew that Halsey had come back . 
What with relief and joy , I began to cry , right there , and very nearly wiped my eyes on Beulah in the excitement . 
CHAPTER IX JUST LIKE A GIRL Aunt Ray ! Halsey said from the gloom behind the lamps . 
What in the world are you doing here ? Taking a walk , I said , trying to be composed . 
I don't think the answer struck either of us as being ridiculous at the time . 
Oh , Halsey , where have you been ? Let me take you up to the house . 
He was in the road , and had Beulah and the basket out of my arms in a moment . 
I could see the car plainly now , and Warner was at the wheel Warner in an ulster and a pair of slippers , over Heaven knows what . 
Jack Bailey was not there . 
I got in , and we went slowly and painfully up to the house . 
Only when we had closed the front door and stood facing each other in the hall , did Halsey say anything . 
He slipped his strong young arm around my shoulders and turned me so I faced the light . 
Poor Aunt Ray ! he said gently . 
And I nearly wept again . 
I I must see Gertrude , too we will have a three cornered talk . 
And then Gertrude herself came down the stairs . 
She had not been to bed , evidently she still wore the white negligee she had worn earlier in the evening , and she limped somewhat . 
During her slow progress down the stairs I had time to notice one thing Mr. Jamieson had said the woman who escaped from the cellar had worn no shoe on her right foot . 
Gertrude's right ankle was the one she had sprained ! The meeting between brother and sister was tense , but without tears . 
Halsey kissed her tenderly , and I noticed evidences of strain and anxiety in both young faces . 
Is everything right ? she asked . 
Right as can be , with forced cheerfulness . 
I lighted the living room and we went in there . 
Now Halsey was here to speak for himself I should learn everything that had puzzled me . 
I saw it in the paper to night for the first time , he was saying . 
When I think of this houseful of women , and a thing like that occurring ! Gertrude's face was still set and white . 
That isn't all , Halsey , she said . 
You and and Jack left almost at the time it happened . 
The detective here thinks that you that we know something about it . 
The devil he does ! Halsey's eyes were fairly starting from his head . 
I beg your pardon , Aunt Ray , but the fellow's a lunatic . 
Tell me everything , won't you , Halsey ? I begged . 
Tell me where you went that night , or rather morning , and why you went as you did . 
This has been a terrible forty eight hours for all of us . 
He stood staring at me , and I could see the horror of the situation dawning in his face . 
I can't tell you where I went , Aunt Ray , he said , after a moment . 
As to why , you will learn that soon enough . 
But Gertrude knows that Jack and I left the house before this thing this horrible murder occurred . 
Mr. Jamieson does not believe me , Gertrude said drearily . 
Halsey , if the worst comes , if they should arrest you , you must tell . 
I shall tell nothing , he said with a new sternness in his voice . 
Aunt Ray , it was necessary for Jack and me to leave that night . 
I can not tell you why just yet . 
As to where we went , if I have to depend on that as an alibi , I shall not tell . 
The whole thing is an absurdity , a trumped up charge that can not possibly be serious . 
Has Mr. Bailey gone back to the city , I demanded , or to the club ? Neither , defiantly at the present moment I do not know where he is . 
I know nothing of it , he maintained but I fancied I caught a sudden glance at Gertrude , a flash of something that died as it came . 
The basket still stood on the table , a mute witness to this last mystifying occurrence . 
There is something else , I said hesitatingly , at the last . 
Halsey , I have never told this even to Gertrude , but the morning after the crime , I found , in a tulip bed , a revolver . 
It it was yours , Halsey . 
For an appreciable moment Halsey stared at me . 
Then he turned to Gertrude . 
My revolver , Trude ! he exclaimed . 
Why , Jack took my revolver with him , didn't he ? Oh , for Heaven's sake don't say that , I implored . 
The detective thinks possibly Jack Bailey came back , and and the thing happened then . 
He didn't come back , Halsey said sternly . 
Gertrude , when you brought down a revolver that night for Jack to take with him , what one did you bring ? Mine ? Gertrude was defiant now . 
No. Yours was loaded , and I was afraid of what Jack might do . 
I gave him one I have had for a year or two . 
Halsey threw up both hands despairingly . 
If that isn't like a girl ! he said . 
The inquest will show , of course , that the bullet that killed Armstrong was a thirty eight . 
Then where shall I be ? You forget , I broke in , that I have the revolver , and that no one knows about it . 
But Gertrude had risen angrily . 
I can not stand it it is always with me , she cried . 
Halsey , I did not throw your revolver into the tulip bed . 
I think you did it yourself ! They stared at each other across the big library table , with young eyes all at once hard , suspicious . 
And then Gertrude held out both hands to him appealingly . 
We must not , she said brokenly . 
Just now , with so much at stake , it is shameful . 
I know you are as ignorant as I am . 
Make me believe it , Halsey . 
Halsey soothed her as best he could , and the breach seemed healed . 
But long after I went to bed he sat down stairs in the living room alone , and I knew he was going over the case as he had learned it . 
Some things were clear to him that were dark to me . 
He knew , and Gertrude , too , why Jack Bailey and he had gone away that night , as they did . 
He knew where they had been for the last forty eight hours , and why Jack Bailey had not returned with him . 
It seemed to me that without fuller confidence from both the children they are always children to me I should never be able to learn anything . 
As I was finally getting ready for bed , Halsey came up stairs and knocked at my door . 
When I had got into a negligee I used to say wrapper before Gertrude came back from school I let him in . 
He stood in the doorway a moment , and then he went into agonies of silent mirth . 
I sat down on the side of the bed and waited in severe silence for him to stop , but he only seemed to grow worse . 
When he had recovered he took me by the elbow and pulled me in front of the mirror . 
How to be beautiful , he quoted . 
Advice to maids and matrons , by Beatrice Fairfax ! And then I saw myself . 
I had neglected to remove my wrinkle eradicators , and I presume my appearance was odd . 
I believe that it is a woman's duty to care for her looks , but it is much like telling a necessary falsehood one must not be found out . 
By the time I got them off Halsey was serious again , and I listened to his story . 
Aunt Ray , he began , extinguishing his cigarette on the back of my ivory hair brush , I would give a lot to tell you the whole thing . 
But I can't , for a day or so , anyhow . 
But one thing I might have told you a long time ago . 
If you had known it , you would not have suspected me for a moment of of having anything to do with the attack on Arnold Armstrong . 
Goodness knows what I might do to a fellow like that , if there was enough provocation , and I had a gun in my hand under ordinary circumstances . 
But I care a great deal about Louise Armstrong , Aunt Ray . 
I hope to marry her some day . 
Is it likely I would kill her brother ? Her stepbrother , I corrected . 
No , of course , it isn't likely , or possible . 
Why didn't you tell me , Halsey ? Well , there were two reasons , he said slowly . 
One was that you had a girl already picked out for me Nonsense , I broke in , and felt myself growing red . 
I had , indeed , one of the but no matter . 
And the second reason , he pursued , was that the Armstrongs would have none of me . 
I sat bolt upright at that and gasped . 
The Armstrongs ! I repeated . 
And the present Innes admits himself he isn't good enough for for Louise . 
Exactly , I said despairingly , and , of course , you are taken at your own valuation . 
The Inneses are not always so self depreciatory . 
Not always , no , he said , looking at me with his boyish smile . 
Fortunately , Louise doesn't agree with her family . 
She's willing to take me , war governor or no , provided her mother consents . 
She isn't overly fond of her stepfather , but she adores her mother . 
And now , can't you see where this thing puts me ? Down and out , with all of them . 
But the whole thing is absurd , I argued . 
And besides , Gertrude's sworn statement that you left before Arnold Armstrong came would clear you at once . 
Halsey got up and began to pace the room , and the air of cheerfulness dropped like a mask . 
She can't swear it , he said finally . 
Gertrude's story was true as far as it went , but she didn't tell everything . 
Arnold Armstrong came here at two thirty came into the billiard room and left in five minutes . 
He came to bring something . 
Halsey , I cried , you MUST tell me the whole truth . 
Every time I see a way for you to escape you block it yourself with this wall of mystery . 
What did he bring ? A telegram for Bailey , he said . 
It came by special messenger from town , and was most important . 
Bailey had started for here , and the messenger had gone back to the city . 
The steward gave it to Arnold , who had been drinking all day and couldn't sleep , and was going for a stroll in the direction of Sunnyside . 
And he brought it ? Yes . 
What was in the telegram ? I can tell you as soon as certain things are made public . 
It is only a matter of days now , gloomily . 
And Gertrude's story of a telephone message ? Poor Trude ! he half whispered . 
Poor loyal little girl ! Aunt Ray , there was no such message . 
No doubt your detective already knows that and discredits all Gertrude told him . 
And when she went back , it was to get the telegram ? Probably , Halsey said slowly . 
I looked at the closed door into Gertrude's dressing room , and lowered my voice . 
The same horrible thought keeps recurring to me , I whispered . 
Halsey , Gertrude probably had your revolver she must have examined it , anyhow , that night . 
After you and Jack had gone , what if that ruffian came back , and she and she I couldn't finish . 
Halsey stood looking at me with shut lips . 
She might have heard him fumbling at the door he had no key , the police say and thinking it was you , or Jack , she admitted him . 
When she saw her mistake she ran up the stairs , a step or two , and turning , like an animal at bay , she fired . 
Halsey had his hand over my lips before I finished , and in that position we stared each at the other , our stricken glances crossing . 
The revolver my revolver thrown into the tulip bed ! he muttered to himself . 
Thrown perhaps from an upper window you say it was buried deep . 
Her prostration ever since , her Aunt Ray , you don't think it was Gertrude who fell down the clothes chute ? I could only nod my head in a hopeless affirmative . 
CHAPTER X THE TRADERS BANK The morning after Halsey's return was Tuesday . 
Arnold Armstrong had been found dead at the foot of the circular staircase at three o'clock on Sunday morning . 
The funeral services were to be held on Tuesday , and the interment of the body was to be deferred until the Armstrongs arrived from California . 
No one , I think , was very sorry that Arnold Armstrong was dead , but the manner of his death aroused some sympathy and an enormous amount of curiosity . 
Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh , a cousin , took charge of the arrangements , and everything , I believe , was as quiet as possible . 
I gave Thomas Johnson and Mrs. Watson permission to go into town to pay their last respects to the dead man , but for some reason they did not care to go . 
Halsey spent part of the day with Mr. Jamieson , but he said nothing of what happened . 
He looked grave and anxious , and he had a long conversation with Gertrude late in the afternoon . 
Tuesday evening found us quiet , with the quiet that precedes an explosion . 
Warner brought up the afternoon mail and the evening papers at seven I was curious to know what the papers said of the murder . 
We had turned away at least a dozen reporters . 
But I read over the head line that ran half way across the top of the Gazette twice before I comprehended it . 
Halsey had opened the Chronicle and was staring at it fixedly . 
The Traders' Bank closes its doors ! was what I read , and then I put down the paper and looked across the table . 
Did you know of this ? I asked Halsey . 
But not so soon , he replied . 
And you ? to Gertrude . 
Jack told us something , Gertrude said faintly . 
Oh , Halsey , what can he do now ? Jack ! I said scornfully . 
Your Jack's flight is easy enough to explain now . 
And you helped him , both of you , to get away ! You get that from your mother it isn't an Innes trait . 
Do you know that every dollar you have , both of you , is in that bank ? Gertrude tried to speak , but Halsey stopped her . 
That isn't all , Gertrude , he said quietly Jack is under arrest . 
Under arrest ! Gertrude screamed , and tore the paper out of his hand . 
She glanced at the heading , then she crumpled the newspaper into a ball and flung it to the floor . 
While Halsey , looking stricken and white , was trying to smooth it out and read it , Gertrude had dropped her head on the table and was sobbing stormily . 
I have the clipping somewhere , but just now I can remember only the essentials . 
As security for the loan he had deposited some three hundred International Steamship Company 's , in total value three hundred thousand dollars . 
Mr. Trautman went to the loan clerk and , after certain formalities had been gone through , the loan clerk went to the vault . 
Mr. Trautman , who was a large and genial German , waited for a time , whistling under his breath . 
The loan clerk did not come back . 
After an interval , Mr. Trautman saw the loan clerk emerge from the vault and go to the assistant cashier the two went hurriedly to the vault . 
A lapse of another ten minutes , and the assistant cashier came out and approached Mr. Trautman . 
He was noticeably white and trembling . 
Mr. Trautman was told that through an oversight the bonds had been misplaced , and was asked to return the following morning , when everything would be made all right . 
Mr. Trautman , however , was a shrewd business man , and he did not like the appearance of things . 
He left the bank apparently satisfied , and within thirty minutes he had called up three different members of the Traders' Board of Directors . 
At three thirty there was a hastily convened board meeting , with some stormy scenes , and late in the afternoon a national bank examiner was in possession of the books . 
The bank had not opened for business on Tuesday . 
As Bailey was highly thought of , Mr. Aronson merely expressed a regret . 
From that time until Monday night , when Mr. Bailey had surrendered to the police , little was known of his movements . 
Some time after one on Saturday he had entered the Western Union office at Cherry and White Streets and had sent two telegrams . 
He was at the Greenwood Country Club on Saturday night , and appeared unlike himself . 
It was reported that he would be released under enormous bond , some time that day , Tuesday . 
The mystery , it insinuated , had not been cleared by the arrest of the cashier . 
Before now minor officials had been used to cloak the misdeeds of men higher up . 
Inseparable as the words speculation and peculation have grown to be , John Bailey was not known to be in the stock market . 
His only words , after his surrender , had been Send for Mr. Armstrong at once . 
That was how things stood that Tuesday evening . 
I sat dazed and bewildered . 
The children's money was gone that was bad enough , though I had plenty , if they would let me share . 
But Gertrude's grief was beyond any power of mine to comfort the man she had chosen stood accused of a colossal embezzlement and even worse . 
For in the instant that I sat there I seemed to see the coils closing around John Bailey as the murderer of Arnold Armstrong . 
Gertrude lifted her head at last and stared across the table at Halsey . 
Why did he do it ? she wailed . 
Couldn't you stop him , Halsey ? It was suicidal to go back ! Halsey was looking steadily through the windows of the breakfast room , but it was evident he saw nothing . 
It was the only thing he could do , Trude , he said at last . 
Aunt Ray , when I found Jack at the Greenwood Club last Saturday night , he was frantic . 
I can not talk until Jack tells me I may , but he is absolutely innocent of all this , believe me . 
I thought , Trude and I thought , we were helping him , but it was the wrong way . 
Isn't that the act of an innocent man ? Then why did he leave at all ? I asked , unconvinced . 
What innocent man would run away from here at three o'clock in the morning ? Doesn't it look rather as though he thought it impossible to escape ? Gertrude rose angrily . 
You are not even just ! she flamed . 
You don't know anything about it , and you condemn him ! I know that we have all lost a great deal of money , I said . 
I shall believe Mr. Bailey innocent the moment he is shown to be . 
You profess to know the truth , but you can not tell me ! What am I to think ? Halsey leaned over and patted my hand . 
You must take us on faith , he said . 
Jack Bailey hasn't a penny that doesn't belong to him the guilty man will be known in a day or so . 
I shall believe that when it is proved , I said grimly . 
In the meantime , I take no one on faith . 
Gertrude , who had been standing aloof at a window , turned suddenly . 
But when the bonds are offered for sale , Halsey , won't the thief be detected at once ? Halsey turned with a superior smile . 
It wouldn't be done that way , he said . 
They would be taken out of the vault by some one who had access to it , and used as collateral for a loan in another bank . 
It would be possible to realize eighty per cent . 
In cash ? In cash . 
But the man who did it he would be known ? Yes . 
I tell you both , as sure as I stand here , I believe that Paul Armstrong looted his own bank . 
I believe he has a million at least , as the result , and that he will never come back . 
I'm worse than a pauper now . 
I can't ask Louise to share nothing a year with me and when I think of this disgrace for her , I'm crazy . 
The most ordinary events of life seemed pregnant with possibilities that day , and when Halsey was called to the telephone , I ceased all pretense at eating . 
When he came back from the telephone his face showed that something had occurred . 
He waited , however , until Thomas left the dining room then he told us . 
Paul Armstrong is dead , he announced gravely . 
He died this morning in California . 
Whatever he did , he is beyond the law now . 
And the only man who could have cleared Jack can never do it ! she said despairingly . 
Also , I replied coldly , Mr. Armstrong is for ever beyond the power of defending himself . 
When your Jack comes to me , with some two hundred thousand dollars in his hands , which is about what you have lost , I shall believe him innocent . 
Halsey threw his cigarette away and turned on me . 
There you go ! he exclaimed . 
If he was the thief , he could return the money , of course . 
If he is innocent , he probably hasn't a tenth of that amount in the world . 
In his hands ! That's like a woman . 
Gertrude , who had been pale and despairing during the early part of the conversation , had flushed an indignant red . 
She got up and drew herself to her slender height , looking down at me with the scorn of the young and positive . 
You are the only mother I ever had , she said tensely . 
I have given you all I would have given my mother , had she lived my love , my trust . 
And now , when I need you most , you fail me . 
I tell you , John Bailey is a good man , an honest man . 
If you say he is not , you you Gertrude , Halsey broke in sharply . 
She dropped beside the table and , burying her face in her arms broke into a storm of tears . 
I love him love him , she sobbed , in a surrender that was totally unlike her . 
Oh , I never thought it would be like this . 
Halsey and I stood helpless before the storm . 
I would have tried to comfort her , but she had put me away , and there was something aloof in her grief , something new and strange . 
At last , when her sorrow had subsided to the dry shaking sobs of a tired child , without raising her head she put out one groping hand . 
Aunt Ray ! she whispered . 
In a moment I was on my knees beside her , her arm around my neck , her cheek against my hair . 
Where am I in this ? Halsey said suddenly and tried to put his arms around us both . 
It was a welcome distraction , and Gertrude was soon herself again . 
The little storm had cleared the air . 
Nevertheless , my opinion remained unchanged . 
There was much to be cleared up before I would consent to any renewal of my acquaintance with John Bailey . 
And Halsey and Gertrude knew it , knowing me . 
The light was thickening , to appropriate Shakespeare's description of twilight , and once again the tree toads and the crickets were making night throb with their tiny life . 
The country after dark oppresses me . 
The stars , quite eclipsed in the city by the electric lights , here become insistent , assertive . 
Whether I want to or not , I find myself looking for the few I know by name , and feeling ridiculously new and small by contrast always an unpleasant sensation . 
After Gertrude joined us , we avoided any further mention of the murder . 
To Halsey , as to me , there was ever present , I am sure , the thought of our conversation of the night before . 
As we strolled back and forth along the drive , Mr. Jamieson emerged from the shadow of the trees . 
Good evening , he said , managing to include Gertrude in his bow . 
Gertrude had never been even ordinarily courteous to him , and she nodded coldly . 
Halsey , however , was more cordial , although we were all constrained enough . 
He and Gertrude went on together , leaving the detective to walk with me . 
As soon as they were out of earshot , he turned to me . 
Do you know , Miss Innes , he said , the deeper I go into this thing , the more strange it seems to me . 
I am very sorry for Miss Gertrude . 
It looks as if Bailey , whom she has tried so hard to save , is worse than a rascal and after her plucky fight for him , it seems hard . 
I looked through the dusk to where Gertrude's light dinner dress gleamed among the trees . 
She HAD made a plucky fight , poor child . 
Whatever she might have been driven to do , I could find nothing but a deep sympathy for her . 
I have a houseful of maids that will bear watching , one and all . 
But there has been no strange woman near the house or Liddy would have seen her , you may be sure . 
She has a telescopic eye . 
It may not amount to anything , he said slowly . 
It is difficult to get any perspective on things around here , because every one down in the village is sure he saw the murderer , either before or since the crime . 
And half of them will stretch a point or two as to facts , to be obliging . 
But the man who drives the hack down there tells a story that may possibly prove to be important . 
I have heard it , I think . 
A veiled lady , he persisted , who was apparently young and beautiful , engaged his hack and asked to be driven to Sunnyside . 
Near the gate , however , she made him stop , in spite of his remonstrances , saying she preferred to walk to the house . 
She paid him , and he left her there . 
Now , Miss Innes , you had no such visitor , I believe ? None , I said decidedly . 
Geist thought it might be a maid , as you had got a supply that day . 
But he said her getting out near the gate puzzled him . 
Anyhow , we have now one veiled lady , who , with the ghostly intruder of Friday night , makes two assets that I hardly know what to do with . 
It is mystifying , I admitted , although I can think of one possible explanation . 
The path from the Greenwood Club to the village enters the road near the lodge gate . 
A woman who wished to reach the Country Club , unperceived , might choose such a method . 
There are plenty of women there . 
I think this gave him something to ponder , for in a short time he said good night and left . 
But I myself was far from satisfied . 
I was determined , however , on one thing . 
If my suspicions for I had suspicions were true , I would make my own investigations , and Mr. Jamieson should learn only what was good for him to know . 
After a little I joined him in the billiard room , and together we went over the details of the discovery of the body . 
The card room was quite dark . 
The window was the same grayish rectangle in the blackness as before . 
A few feet away in the hall was the spot where the body of Arnold Armstrong had been found . 
I was a bit nervous , and I put my hand on Halsey's sleeve . 
Suddenly , from the top of the staircase above us came the sound of a cautious footstep . 
At first I was not sure , but Halsey's attitude told me he had heard and was listening . 
The step , slow , measured , infinitely cautious , was nearer now . 
Halsey tried to loosen my fingers , but I was in a paralysis of fright . 
Halsey threw me off then and strode forward . 
Who is it ? he called imperiously , and took a half dozen rapid strides toward the foot of the staircase . 
Then I heard him mutter something there was the crash of a falling body , the slam of the outer door , and , for an instant , quiet . 
I screamed , I think . 
Then I remember turning on the lights and finding Halsey , white with fury , trying to untangle himself from something warm and fleecy . 
He had cut his forehead a little on the lowest step of the stairs , and he was rather a ghastly sight . 
He flung the white object at me , and , jerking open the outer door , raced into the darkness . 
Gertrude was the first to speak . 
Somebody had it ? she asked . 
Halsey tried to stop whoever it was and fell . 
Gertrude , that blanket is not mine . 
I have never seen before . 
She held it up and looked at it then she went to the door on to the veranda and threw it open . 
Perhaps a hundred feet from the house were two figures , that moved slowly toward us as we looked . 
When they came within range of the light , I recognized Halsey , and with him Mrs. Watson , the housekeeper . 
CHAPTER XII ONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER The most commonplace incident takes on a new appearance if the attendant circumstances are unusual . 
There was no reason on earth why Mrs. Watson should not have carried a blanket down the east wing staircase , if she so desired . 
They moved slowly across the lawn and up the steps . 
Halsey was talking quietly , and Mrs. Watson was looking down and listening . 
She was a woman of a certain amount of dignity , most efficient , so far as I could see , although Liddy would have found fault if she dared . 
But just now Mrs. Watson's face was an enigma . 
She was defiant , I think , under her mask of submission , and she still showed the effect of nervous shock . 
Mrs. Watson , I said severely , will you be so good as to explain this rather unusual occurrence ? I don't think it so unusual , Miss Innes . 
Her voice was deep and very clear just now it was somewhat tremulous . 
Halsey was examining the cut on his forehead in a small mirror on the wall . 
It was not much of an injury , but it had bled freely , and his appearance was rather terrifying . 
Thomas ill ? he said , over his shoulder . 
Why , I thought I saw Thomas out there as you made that cyclonic break out of the door and over the porch . 
I could see that under pretense of examining his injury he was watching her through the mirror . 
Is this one of the servants' blankets , Mrs. Watson ? I asked , holding up its luxurious folds to the light . 
Everything else is locked away , she replied . 
Which was true enough , no doubt . 
I had rented the house without bed furnishings . 
If Thomas is ill , Halsey said , some member of the family ought to go down to see him . 
You needn't bother , Mrs. Watson . 
I will take the blanket . 
She drew herself up quickly , as if in protest , but she found nothing to say . 
She stood smoothing the folds of her dead black dress , her face as white as chalk above it . 
Then she seemed to make up her mind . 
Very well , Mr. Innes , she said . 
Perhaps you would better go . 
I have done all I could . 
And then she turned and went up the circular staircase , moving slowly and with a certain dignity . 
Below , the three of us stared at one another across the intervening white blanket . 
Upon my word , Halsey broke out , this place is a walking nightmare . 
I have the feeling that we three outsiders who have paid our money for the privilege of staying in this spook factory , are living on the very top of things . 
We're on the lid , so to speak . 
Now and then we get a sight of the things inside , but we are not a part of them . 
It's down to this , Aunt Ray . 
Rosie's basket and Mrs Watson's blanket can only mean one thing there is somebody hiding or being hidden in the lodge . 
It wouldn't surprise me if we hold the key to the whole situation now . 
Anyhow , I'm going to the lodge to investigate . 
Gertrude wanted to go , too , but she looked so shaken that I insisted she should not . 
I sent for Liddy to help her to bed , and then Halsey and I started for the lodge . 
The grass was heavy with dew , and , man like , Halsey chose the shortest way across the lawn . 
Half way , however , he stopped . 
We'd better go by the drive , he said . 
This isn't a lawn it's a field . 
Where's the gardener these days ? There isn't any , I said meekly . 
We have been thankful enough , so far , to have our meals prepared and served and the beds aired . 
The gardener who belongs here is working at the club . 
Remind me to morrow to send out a man from town , he said . 
I know the very fellow . 
At that time , however , I was busy trying to keep my skirts dry , and paid little or no attention to what seemed then a most trivial remark . 
Along the drive I showed Halsey where I had found Rosie's basket with the bits of broken china piled inside . 
Warner probably , he said when I had finished . 
Began it as a joke on Rosie , and ended by picking up the broken china out of the road , knowing it would play hob with the tires of the car . 
Which shows how near one can come to the truth , and yet miss it altogether . 
At the lodge everything was quiet . 
There was a light in the sitting room down stairs , and a faint gleam , as if from a shaded lamp , in one of the upper rooms . 
Halsey stopped and examined the lodge with calculating eyes . 
I don't know , Aunt Ray , he said dubiously this is hardly a woman's affair . 
If there's a scrap of any kind , you hike for the timber . 
Which was Halsey's solicitous care for me , put into vernacular . 
I shall stay right here , I said , and crossing the small veranda , now shaded and fragrant with honeysuckle , I hammered the knocker on the door . 
Thomas opened the door himself Thomas , fully dressed and in his customary health . 
I had the blanket over my arm . 
I brought the blanket , Thomas , I said I am sorry you are so ill . 
The old man stood staring at me and then at the blanket . 
His confusion under other circumstances would have been ludicrous . 
What ! Not ill ? Halsey said from the step . 
Thomas , I'm afraid you've been malingering . 
Thomas seemed to have been debating something with himself . 
Now he stepped out on the porch and closed the door gently behind him . 
I reckon you bettah come in , Mis' Innes , he said , speaking cautiously . 
It's got so I dunno what to do , and it's boun' to come out some time er ruther . 
He threw the door open then , and I stepped inside , Halsey close behind . 
In the sitting room the old negro turned with quiet dignity to Halsey . 
You bettah sit down , sah , he said . 
It's a place for a woman , sah . 
Things were not turning out the way Halsey expected . 
He sat down on the center table , with his hands thrust in his pockets , and watched me as I followed Thomas up the narrow stairs . 
At the top a woman was standing , and a second glance showed me it was Rosie . 
She shrank back a little , but I said nothing . 
And then Thomas motioned to a partly open door , and I went in . 
The lodge boasted three bedrooms up stairs , all comfortably furnished . 
In this one , the largest and airiest , a night lamp was burning , and by its light I could make out a plain white metal bed . 
A girl was asleep there or in a half stupor , for she muttered something now and then . 
Rosie had taken her courage in her hands , and coming in had turned up the light . 
It was only then that I knew . 
Fever flushed , ill as she was , I recognized Louise Armstrong . 
I stood gazing down at her in a stupor of amazement . 
Louise here , hiding at the lodge , ill and alone ! Rosie came up to the bed and smoothed the white counterpane . 
I am afraid she is worse to night , she ventured at last . 
I put my hand on the sick girl's forehead . 
It was burning with fever , and I turned to where Thomas lingered in the hallway . 
Will you tell me what you mean , Thomas Johnson , by not telling me this before ? I demanded indignantly . 
Mis' Louise wouldn' let me , he said earnestly . 
She ought to 'a' had a doctor the night she came , but she wouldn' hear to it . 
Is she is she very bad , Mis' Innes ? Bad enough , I said coldly . 
Halsey came up the stairs slowly , looking rather interested and inclined to be amused . 
I think he felt who it was before he really saw her he crossed the room in a couple of strides and bent over the bed . 
Louise ! he said softly but she did not reply , and her eyes showed no recognition . 
Halsey was young , and illness was new to him . 
He straightened himself slowly , still watching her , and caught my arm . 
She's dying , Aunt Ray ! he said huskily . 
Dying ! Why , she doesn't know me ! Fudge ! I snapped , being apt to grow irritable when my sympathies are aroused . 
She's doing nothing of the sort , and don't pinch my arm . 
If you want something to do , go and choke Thomas . 
But at that moment Louise roused from her stupor to cough , and at the end of the paroxysm , as Rosie laid her back , exhausted , she knew us . 
That was all Halsey wanted to him consciousness was recovery . 
And at that I came to my senses , and put him out . 
This instant ! I ordered , as he hesitated . 
He did not go far . 
He sat on the top step of the stairs , only leaving to telephone for a doctor , and getting in everybody's way in his eagerness to fetch and carry . 
I got him away finally , by sending him to fix up the car as a sort of ambulance , in case the doctor would allow the sick girl to be moved . 
On Saturday evening before , about ten o'clock , he had been reading in the sitting room down stairs , when some one rapped at the door . 
The old man was alone , Warner not having arrived , and at first he was uncertain about opening the door . 
He did so finally , and was amazed at being confronted by Louise Armstrong . 
Thomas was an old family servant , having been with the present Mrs. Armstrong since she was a child , and he was overwhelmed at seeing Louise . 
He saw that she was excited and tired , and he drew her into the sitting room and made her sit down . 
After a while he went to the house and brought Mrs. Watson , and they talked until late . 
The old man said Louise was in trouble , and seemed frightened . 
Mrs. Watson made some tea and took it to the lodge , but Louise made them both promise to keep her presence a secret . 
She had not known that Sunnyside was rented , and whatever her trouble was , this complicated things . 
Her stepfather and her mother were still in California that was all she would say about them . 
Why she had run away no one could imagine . 
Mr. Arnold Armstrong was at the Greenwood Club , and at last Thomas , not knowing what else to do , went over there along the path . 
Part way over he met Armstrong himself and brought him to the lodge . 
Mrs. Watson had gone to the house for some bed linen , it having been arranged that under the circumstances Louise would be better at the lodge until morning . 
Arnold Armstrong and Louise had a long conference , during which he was heard to storm and become very violent . 
When he left it was after two . 
He had gone up to the house Thomas did not know why and at three o'clock he was shot at the foot of the circular staircase . 
The following morning Louise had been ill . 
She had asked for Arnold , and was told he had left town . 
Thomas had not the moral courage to tell her of the crime . 
She refused a doctor , and shrank morbidly from having her presence known . 
Mrs. Watson and Thomas had had their hands full , and at last Rosie had been enlisted to help them . 
She carried necessary provisions little enough to the lodge , and helped to keep the secret . 
With the death of her stepfather and the prospect of the immediate return of the family , things had become more and more impossible . 
I gathered that Thomas was as relieved as I at the turn events had taken . 
No , she did not know of either of the deaths in the family . 
Taken all around , I had only substituted one mystery for another . 
If I knew now why Rosie had taken the basket of dishes , I did not know who had spoken to her and followed her along the drive . 
If I knew that Louise was in the lodge , I did not know why she was there . 
If I knew that Arnold Armstrong had spent some time in the lodge the night before he was murdered , I was no nearer the solution of the crime . 
CHAPTER XIII LOUISE The doctor from Englewood came very soon , and I went up to see the sick girl with him . 
Halsey had gone to supervise the fitting of the car with blankets and pillows , and Gertrude was opening and airing Louise's own rooms at the house . 
Her private sitting room , bedroom and dressing room were as they had been when we came . 
They occupied the end of the east wing , beyond the circular staircase , and we had not even opened them . 
The girl herself was too ill to notice what was being done . 
Doctor Stewart that was the Englewood doctor stayed almost all night , giving the medicine himself , and watching her closely . 
Afterward he told me that she had had a narrow escape from pneumonia , and that the cerebral symptoms had been rather alarming . 
I said I was glad it wasn't an itis of some kind , anyhow , and he smiled solemnly . 
He left after breakfast , saying that he thought the worst of the danger was over , and that she must be kept very quiet . 
The shock of two deaths , I suppose , has done this , he remarked , picking up his case . 
It has been very deplorable . 
I hastened to set him right . 
She does not know of either , Doctor , I said . 
Please do not mention them to her . 
He looked as surprised as a medical man ever does . 
I do not know the family , he said , preparing to get into his top buggy . 
Young Walker , down in Casanova , has been attending them . 
I understand he is going to marry this young lady . 
You have been misinformed , I said stiffly . 
Miss Armstrong is going to marry my nephew . 
The doctor smiled as he picked up the reins . 
Young ladies are changeable these days , he said . 
We thought the wedding was to occur soon . 
Well , I will stop in this afternoon to see how my patient is getting along . 
He drove away then , and I stood looking after him . 
When I was a girl we called in the doctor alike when we had measles , or when mother's sister died in the far West . 
He cut out redundant tonsils and brought the babies with the same air of inspiring self confidence . 
Nowadays it requires a different specialist for each of these occurrences . 
When the babies cried , old Doctor Wainwright gave them peppermint and dropped warm sweet oil in their ears with sublime faith that if it was not colic it was earache . 
Ah , well , Doctor Wainwright is gone , and I am an elderly woman with an increasing tendency to live in the past . 
The contrast between my old doctor at home and the Casanova doctor , Frank Walker , always rouses me to wrath and digression . 
Some time about noon of that day , Wednesday , Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh telephoned me . 
Beyond that , and her reputation at bridge , which is insufferably bad she is the worst player at the bridge club I know little of her . 
It was she who had taken charge of Arnold Armstrong's funeral , however , and I went at once to the telephone . 
Yes , I said , this is Miss Innes . 
Miss Innes , she said volubly , I have just received a very strange telegram from my cousin , Mrs. Armstrong . 
Her husband died yesterday , in California and wait , I will read you the message . 
I knew what was coming , and I made up my mind at once . 
Louise herself must notify her people . 
I do not justify myself now , but remember , I was in a peculiar position toward the Armstrong family . 
I was connected most unpleasantly with a cold blooded crime , and my niece and nephew were practically beggared , either directly or indirectly , through the head of the family . 
Mrs. Fitzhugh had found the message . 
Heart disease , she read . 
Wire at once if Louise is with you . 
You see , Miss Innes , Louise must have started east , and Fanny is alarmed about her . 
Louise is not here , Mrs. Fitzhugh went on , and none of her friends the few who are still in town has seen her . 
I called you because Sunnyside was not rented when she went away , and Louise might have , gone there . 
I am sorry , Mrs. Fitzhugh , but I can not help you , I said , and was immediately filled with compunction . 
Suppose Louise grew worse ? Who was I to play Providence in this case ? The anxious mother certainly had a right to know that her daughter was in good hands . 
So I broke in on Mrs. Fitzhugh's voluble excuses for disturbing me . 
Mrs. Fitzhugh , I said . 
I was going to let you think I knew nothing about Louise Armstrong , but I have changed my mind . 
Louise is here , with me . 
There was a clatter of ejaculations at the other end of the wire . 
She is ill , and not able to be moved . 
Moreover , she is unable to see any one . 
I wish you would wire her mother that she is with me , and tell her not to worry . 
No , I do not know why she came east . 
But my dear Miss Innes ! Mrs. Fitzhugh began . 
I will send for you as soon as she can see you , I said . 
No , she is not in a critical state now , but the doctor says she must have absolute quiet . 
When I had hung up the receiver , I sat down to think . 
She had always been high spirited , with the well poised head and buoyant step of the outdoors girl . 
It must have been much more in keeping with Louise's character , as I knew it , to resent vigorously any unwelcome attentions from Doctor Walker . 
It was the suitor whom I should have expected to see in headlong flight , not the lady in the case . 
The puzzle was no clearer at the end of the half hour . 
I picked up the morning papers , which were still full of the looting of the Traders' Bank , the interest at fever height again , on account of Paul Armstrong's death . 
The bank examiners were working on the books , and said nothing for publication John Bailey had been released on bond . 
The body of Paul Armstrong would arrive Sunday and would be buried from the Armstrong town house . 
There were rumors that the dead man's estate had been a comparatively small one . 
The last paragraph was the important one . 
The gardener mentioned by Halsey came out about two o'clock in the afternoon , and walked up from the station . 
I was favorably impressed by him . 
His references were good he had been employed by the Brays' until they went to Europe , and he looked young and vigorous . 
He asked for one assistant , and I was glad enough to get off so easily . 
He was a pleasant faced young fellow , with black hair and blue eyes , and his name was Alexander Graham . 
I have been particular about Alex , because , as I said before , he played an important part later . 
That afternoon I had a new insight into the character of the dead banker . 
I had my first conversation with Louise . 
She sent for me , and against my better judgment I went . 
There were so many things she could not be told , in her weakened condition , that I dreaded the interview . 
It was much easier than I espected , however , because she asked no questions . 
Liddy was in attendance in the sick room . 
There being little or nothing to do , she seemed to spend her time smoothing the wrinkles from the counterpane . 
Louise lay under a field of virgin white , folded back at an angle of geometrical exactness , and necessitating a readjustment every time the sick girl turned . 
Liddy heard my approach and came out to meet me . 
She seemed to be in a perpetual state of goose flesh , and she had got in the habit of looking past me when she talked , as if she saw things . 
It had the effect of making me look over my shoulder to see what she was staring at , and was intensely irritating . 
She's awake , Liddy said , looking uneasily down the circular staircase , which was beside me . 
She was talkin' in her sleep something awful about dead men and coffins . 
Liddy , I said sternly , did you breathe a word about everything not being right here ? Liddy's gaze had wandered to the door of the chute , now bolted securely . 
Not a word , she said , beyond asking her a question or two , which there was no harm in . 
She says there never was a ghost known here . 
I glared at her , speechless , and closing the door into Louise's boudoir , to Liddy's great disappointment , I went on to the bedroom beyond . 
Whatever Paul Armstrong had been , he had been lavish with his stepdaughter . 
Gertrude's rooms at home were always beautiful apartments , but the three rooms in the east wing at Sunnyside , set apart for the daughter of the house , were much more splendid . 
In the bedroom Louise was watching for me . 
It was easy to see that she was much improved the flush was going , and the peculiar gasping breathing of the night before was now a comfortable and easy respiration . 
She held out her hand and I took it between both of mine . 
What can I say to you , Miss Innes ? she said slowly . 
To have come like this I thought she was going to break down , but she did not . 
You are not to think of anything but of getting well , I said , patting her hand . 
When you are better , I am going to scold you for not coming here at once . 
This is your home , my dear , and of all people in the world , Halsey's old aunt ought to make you welcome . 
She smiled a little , sadly , I thought . 
I ought not to see Halsey , she said . 
Miss Innes , there are a great many things you will never understand , I am afraid . 
I am an impostor on your sympathy , because I I stay here and let you lavish care on me , and all the time I know you are going to despise me . 
Nonsense ! I said briskly . 
Indeed , he would be quite capable of it . 
She seemed scarcely to hear my facetious tone . 
Poor Halsey ! she said softly . 
Miss Innes , I can not marry him , and I am afraid to tell him . 
I am a coward a coward ! I sat beside the bed and stared at her . 
She was too ill to argue with , and , besides , sick people take queer fancies . 
We will talk about that when you are stronger , I said gently . 
But there are some things I must tell you , she insisted . 
You must wonder how I came here , and why I stayed hidden at the lodge . 
Dear old Thomas has been almost crazy , Miss Innes . 
I did not know that Sunnyside was rented . 
I knew my mother wished to rent it , without telling my stepfather , but the news must have reached her after I left . 
When I started east , I had only one idea to be alone with my thoughts for a time , to bury myself here . 
Then , I must have taken a cold on the train . 
You came east in clothing suitable for California , I said , and , like all young girls nowadays , I don't suppose you wear flannels . 
But she was not listening . 
Miss Innes , she said , has my stepbrother Arnold gone away ? What do you mean ? I asked , startled . 
He didn't come back that night , she said , and it was so important that I should see him . 
I believe he has gone away , I replied uncertainly . 
Isn't it something that we could attend to instead ? But she shook her head . 
I must do it myself , she said dully . 
But we have never had any money , Miss Innes that must have been why mother rented this house . 
My stepfather pays out bills . 
It's the most maddening , humiliating existence in the world . 
I would love honest poverty better . 
Never mind , I said when you and Halsey are married you can be as honest as you like , and you will certainly be poor . 
Halsey came to the door at that moment and I could hear him coaxing Liddy for admission to the sick room . 
Shall I bring him in ? I asked Louise , uncertain what to do . 
The girl seemed to shrink back among her pillows at the sound of his voice . 
I was vaguely irritated with her there are few young fellows like Halsey straightforward , honest , and willing to sacrifice everything for the one woman . 
I knew one once , more than thirty years ago , who was like that he died a long time ago . 
And sometimes I take out his picture , with its cane and its queer silk hat , and look at it . 
But of late years it has grown too painful he is always a boy and I am an old woman . 
I would not bring him back if I could . 
Perhaps it was some such memory that made me call out sharply . 
And then I took my sewing and went into the boudoir beyond , to play propriety . 
I did not try to hear what they said , but every word came through the open door with curious distinctness . 
Halsey had evidently gone over to the bed and I suppose he kissed her . 
There was silence for a moment , as if words were superfluous things . 
I have been almost wild , sweetheart , Halsey's voice . 
Why didn't you trust me , and send for me before ? It was because I couldn't trust myself , she said in a low tone . 
I am too weak to struggle to day oh , Halsey , how I have wanted to see you ! There was something I did not hear , then Halsey again . 
We could go away , he was saying . 
You don't know you don't know , Louise repeated dully . 
Halsey , I care you know that but not enough to marry you . 
That is not true , Louise , he said sternly . 
You can not look at me with your honest eyes and say that . 
I can not marry you , she repeated miserably . 
It's bad enough , isn't it ? Don't make it worse . 
Some day , before long , you will be glad . 
Then it is because you have never loved me . 
There were depths of hurt pride in his voice . 
You saw how much I loved you , and you let me think you cared for a while . 
No that isn't like you , Louise . 
There is something you haven't told me . 
Is it because there is some one else ? Yes , almost inaudibly . 
Louise ! Oh , I don't believe it . 
It is true , she said sadly . 
Halsey , you must not try to see me again . 
As soon as I can , I am going away from here where you are all so much kinder than I deserve . 
And whatever you hear about me , try to think as well of me as you can . 
I am going to marry another man . 
How you must hate me hate me ! I could hear Halsey cross the room to the window . 
Then , after a pause , he went back to her again . 
I could hardly sit still I wanted to go in and give her a good shaking . 
Then it's all over , he was saying with a long breath . 
I could hear Halsey's low triumphant laugh . 
I defy him , he said . 
Sweetheart , as long as you care for me , I am not afraid . 
The wind slammed the door between the two rooms just then , and I could hear nothing more , although I moved my chair quite close . 
After a discreet interval , I went into the other room , and found Louise alone . 
She was staring with sad eyes at the cherub painted on the ceiling over the bed , and because she looked tired I did not disturb her . 
CHAPTER XIV AN EGG NOG AND A TELEGRAM We had discovered Louise at the lodge Tuesday night . 
It was Wednesday I had my interview with her . 
Thursday and Friday were uneventful , save as they marked improvement in our patient . 
Gertrude spent almost all the time with her , and the two had grown to be great friends . 
We had not told Louise of either death . 
Then , too , I was anxious about the children . 
With their mother's inheritance swept away in the wreck of the bank , and with their love affairs in a disastrous condition , things could scarcely be worse . 
Added to that , the cook and Liddy had a flare up over the proper way to make beef tea for Louise , and , of course , the cook left . 
Mrs. Watson had been glad enough , I think , to turn Louise over to our care , and Thomas went upstairs night and morning to greet his young mistress from the doorway . 
Poor Thomas ! He had the faculty found still in some old negroes , who cling to the traditions of slavery days of making his employer's interest his . 
He had been advised , he said , that Mrs. Armstrong was coming east with her husband's body and would arrive Monday . 
Surely you are mistaken , Mr. Harton . 
I should think , after what happened here only a few days ago , she would never wish to come back . 
Nevertheless , he replied , she is most anxious to come . 
This is what she says . 
Use every possible means to have Sunnyside vacated . 
Must go there at once . 
Mr. Harton , I said testily , I am not going to do anything of the kind . 
I and mine have suffered enough at the hands of this family . 
I rented the house at an exorbitant figure and I have moved out here for the summer . 
My city home is dismantled and in the hands of decorators . 
I have been here one week , during which I have had not a single night of uninterrupted sleep , and I intend to stay until I have recuperated . 
Moreover , if Mr. Armstrong died insolvent , as I believe was the case , his widow ought to be glad to be rid of so expensive a piece of property . 
The lawyer cleared his throat . 
I am very sorry you have made this decision , he said . 
Miss Innes , Mrs. Fitzhugh tells me Louise Armstrong is with you . 
Has she been informed of this double bereavement ? Not yet , I said . 
She has been very ill perhaps to night she can be told . 
It is very sad very sad , he said . 
I have a telegram for her , Mrs. Innes . 
Shall I send it out ? Better open it and read it to me , I suggested . 
If it is important , that will save time . 
There was a pause while Mr. Harton opened the telegram . 
Then he read it slowly , judicially . 
Signed F. L. W. Hum ! I said . 
Very well , Mr. Harton , I will tell her , but she is not in condition to watch for any one . 
Well , Miss Innes , if you decide to er relinquish the lease , let me know , the lawyer said . 
I shall not relinquish it , I replied , and I imagined his irritation from the way he hung up the receiver . 
I wrote the telegram down word for word , afraid to trust my memory , and decided to ask Doctor Stewart how soon Louise might be told the truth . 
Real eggs , he said proudly . 
None of your anemic store eggs , but the real thing some of them still warm . 
Feel them ! Egg nog for Miss Louise . 
He was beaming with satisfaction , and before he left , he insisted on going back to the pantry and making an egg nog with his own hands . 
Somehow , all the time he was doing it , I had a vision of Doctor Willoughby , my nerve specialist in the city , trying to make an egg nog . 
I wondered if he ever prescribed anything so plebeian and so delicious . 
And while Doctor Stewart whisked the eggs he talked . 
Nothing of the sort , I protested . 
The egg nog was finished . 
Real eggs , real milk , and a touch of real Kentucky whisky , he said . 
He insisted on carrying it up himself , but at the foot of the stairs he paused . 
Riggs said the plans were drawn for the house , he said , harking back to the old subject . 
Drawn by Huston in town . 
So I naturally believed him . 
When the doctor came down , I was ready with a question . 
Doctor , I asked , is there any one in the neighborhood named Carrington ? Nina Carrington ? Carrington ? He wrinkled his forehead . 
Carrington ? No , I don't remember any such family . 
There used to be Covingtons down the creek . 
The name was Carrington , I said , and the subject lapsed . 
Gertrude and Halsey went for a long walk that afternoon , and Louise slept . 
Time hung heavy on my hands , and I did as I had fallen into a habit of doing lately I sat down and thought things over . 
One result of my meditations was that I got up suddenly and went to the telephone . 
I had taken the most intense dislike to this Doctor Walker , whom I had never seen , and who was being talked of in the countryside as the fiance of Louise Armstrong . 
I knew Sam Huston well . 
There had been a time , when Sam was a good deal younger than he is now , before he had married Anne Endicott , when I knew him even better . 
So now I felt no hesitation in calling him over the telephone . 
Why , how are you , Rachel ? Sam said sonorously . 
Going to build that house at Rock View ? It was a twenty year old joke of his . 
Sometime , perhaps , I said . 
Just now I want to ask you a question about something which is none of my business . 
I see you haven't changed an iota in a quarter of a century , Rachel . 
This was intended to be another jest . 
Ask ahead everything but my domestic affairs is at your service . 
Try to be serious , I said . 
And tell me this has your firm made any plans for a house recently , for a Doctor Walker , at Casanova ? Yes , we have . 
Where was it to be built ? I have a reason for asking . 
It was to be , I believe , on the Armstrong place . 
When the architect had inquired for the different members of my family , and had finally rung off , I was certain of one thing . 
Louise Armstrong was in love with Halsey , and the man she was going to marry was Doctor Walker . 
Moreover , this decision was not new marriage had been contemplated for some time . 
There must certainly be some explanation but what was it ? That day I repeated to Louise the telegram Mr. Warton had opened . 
She seemed to understand , but an unhappier face I have never seen . 
She looked like a criminal whose reprieve is over , and the day of execution approaching . 
CHAPTER XV LIDDY GIVES THE ALARM The next day , Friday , Gertrude broke the news of her stepfather's death to Louise . 
She did it as gently as she could , telling her first that he was very ill , and finally that he was dead . 
Louise received the news in the most unexpected manner , and when Gertrude came out to tell me how she had stood it , I think she was almost shocked . 
She just lay and stared at me , Aunt Ray , she said . 
Do you know , I believe she is glad , glad ! And she is too honest to pretend anything else . 
What sort of man was Mr. Paul Armstrong , anyhow ? He was a bully as well as a rascal , Gertrude , I said . 
But I am convinced of one thing Louise will send for Halsey now , and they will make it all up . 
For Louise had steadily refused to see Halsey all that day , and the boy was frantic . 
He sat back in a big chair , with his face in the shadow , and my heart fairly ached for him . 
He was so big and so boyish ! When I had finished he drew a long breath . 
Whatever Louise does , he said , nothing will convince me , Aunt Ray , that she doesn't care for me . 
And up to two months ago , when she and her mother went west , I was the happiest fellow on earth . 
I was not to write until she wrote me , and whatever occurred , I was to think the best I could of her . 
It sounded like a puzzle . 
When I saw her yesterday , it was the same thing , only , perhaps , worse . 
Halsey , I asked , have you any idea of the nature of the interview between Louise Armstrong and Arnold the night he was murdered ? It was stormy . 
Thomas says once or twice he almost broke into the room , he was so alarmed for Louise . 
Another thing , Halsey , I said , have you ever heard Louise mention a woman named Carrington , Nina Carrington ? Never , he said positively . 
For try as we would , our thoughts always came back to that fatal Saturday night , and the murder . 
Every conversational path led to it , and we all felt that Jamieson was tightening the threads of evidence around John Bailey . 
The detective's absence was hardly reassuring he must have had something to work on in town , or he would have returned . 
The papers reported that the cashier of the Traders' Bank was ill in his apartments at the Knickerbocker a condition not surprising , considering everything . 
The guilt of the defunct president was no longer in doubt the missing bonds had been advertised and some of them discovered . 
In every instance they had been used as collateral for large loans , and the belief was current that not less than a million and a half dollars had been realized . 
Every one connected with the bank had been placed under arrest , and released on heavy bond . 
The rest lost in speculation probably , the papers said . 
The business alliance between the two men added to the belief that Bailey knew something of the looting . 
His unexplained absence from the bank on Monday lent color to the suspicion against him . 
The strange thing seemed to be his surrendering himself on the point of departure . 
To me , it seemed the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal . 
I was not actively antagonistic to Gertrude's lover , but I meant to be convinced , one way or the other . 
I took no one on faith . 
That night the Sunnyside ghost began to walk again . 
Liddy had been sleeping in Louise's dressing room on a couch , and the approach of dusk was a signal for her to barricade the entire suite . 
Situated as its was , beyond the circular staircase , nothing but an extremity of excitement would have made her pass it after dark . 
On Friday night , then , I had gone to bed , resolved to go at once to sleep . 
Thoughts that insisted on obtruding themselves I pushed resolutely to the back of my mind , and I systematically relaxed every muscle . 
I was up at once , and with the sound of my footstep on the floor the low knocking ceased , to be followed immediately by sibilant whispering through the keyhole . 
Miss Rachel ! Miss Rachel ! somebody was saying , over and over . 
Is that you , Liddy ? I asked , my hand on the knob . 
For the love of mercy , let me in ! she said in a low tone . 
She was leaning against the door , for when I opened it , she fell in . 
She was greenish white , and she had a red and black barred flannel petticoat over her shoulders . 
Listen , she said , standing in the middle of the floor and holding on to me . 
Oh , Miss Rachel , it's the ghost of that dead man hammering to get in ! Sure enough , there was a dull thud thud thud from some place near . 
It was muffled one rather felt than heard it , and it was impossible to locate . 
One moment it seemed to come , three taps and a pause , from the floor under us the next , thud thud thud it came apparently from the wall . 
It's not a ghost , I said decidedly . 
If it was a ghost it wouldn't rap it would come through the keyhole . 
Liddy looked at the keyhole . 
But it sounds very much as though some one is trying to break into the house . 
I told her to get me my slippers and she brought me a pair of kid gloves , so I found my things myself , and prepared to call Halsey . 
As before , the night alarm had found the electric lights gone the hall , save for its night lamp , was in darkness , as I went across to Halsey's room . 
I hardly know what I feared , but it was a relief to find him there , very sound asleep , and with his door unlocked . 
Wake up , Halsey , I said , shaking him . 
Liddy was half in and half out of the door , afraid as usual to be left alone , and not quite daring to enter . 
Her scruples seemed to fade , however , all at once . 
She gave a suppressed yell , bolted into the room , and stood tightly clutching the foot board of the bed . 
I've seen it , Liddy wailed . 
A woman in white down the hall ! I paid no attention . 
Halsey , I persevered , some one is breaking into the house . 
Get up , won't you ? It isn't our house , he said sleepily . 
And then he roused to the exigency of the occasion . 
All right , Aunt Ray , he said , still yawning . 
If you'll let me get into something It was all I could do to get Liddy out of the room . 
The demands of the occasion had no influence on her she had seen the ghost , she persisted , and she wasn't going into the hall . 
But I got her over to my room at last , more dead than alive , and made her lie down on the bed . 
The tappings , which seemed to have ceased for a while , had commenced again , but they were fainter . 
Halsey came over in a few minutes , and stood listening and trying to locate the sound . 
Give me my revolver , Aunt Ray , he said and I got it the one I had found in the tulip bed and gave it to him . 
He saw Liddy there and divined at once that Louise was alone . 
You let me attend to this fellow , whoever it is , Aunt Ray , and go to Louise , will you ? She may be awake and alarmed . 
So in spite of her protests , I left Liddy alone and went back to the east wing . 
Perhaps I went a little faster past the yawning blackness of the circular staircase and I could hear Halsey creaking cautiously down the main staircase . 
The rapping , or pounding , had ceased , and the silence was almost painful . 
And then suddenly , from apparently under my very feet , there rose a woman's scream , a cry of terror that broke off as suddenly as it came . 
I stood frozen and still . 
Every drop of blood in my body seemed to leave the surface and gather around my heart . 
In the dead silence that followed it throbbed as if it would burst . 
More dead than alive , I stumbled into Louise's bedroom . 
She was not there ! CHAPTER XVII IN THE EARLY MORNING I stood looking at the empty bed . 
The coverings had been thrown back , and Louise's pink silk dressing gown was gone from the foot , where it had lain . 
The night lamp burned dimly , revealing the emptiness of the place . 
I picked it up , but my hand shook so that I put it down again , and got somehow to the door . 
There were voices in the hall and Gertrude came running toward me . 
What is it ? she cried . 
What was that sound ? Where is Louise ? She is not in her room , I said stupidly . 
I think it was she who screamed . 
Liddy had joined us now , carrying a light . 
We stood huddled together at the head of the circular staircase , looking down into its shadows . 
There was nothing to be seen , and it was absolutely quiet down there . 
Then we heard Halsey running up the main staircase . 
He came quickly down the hall to where we were standing . 
There's no one trying to get in . 
I thought I heard some one shriek . 
Who was it ? Our stricken faces told him the truth . 
Some one screamed down there , I said . 
And and Louise is not in her room . 
With a jerk Halsey took the light from Liddy and ran down the circular staircase . 
I followed him , more slowly . 
My nerves seemed to be in a state of paralysis I could scarcely step . 
At the foot of the stairs Halsey gave an exclamation and put down the light . 
Aunt Ray , he called sharply . 
At the foot of the staircase , huddled in a heap , her head on the lower stair , was Louise Armstrong . 
She was not dead Halsey put her down on the floor , and began to rub her cold hands , while Gertrude and Liddy ran for stimulants . 
As for me , I sat there at the foot of that ghostly staircase sat , because my knees wouldn't hold me and wondered where it would all end . 
Louise was still unconscious , but she was breathing better , and I suggested that we get her back to bed before she came to . 
There was something grisly and horrible to me , seeing her there in almost the same attitude and in the same place where we had found her brother's body . 
And to add to the similarity , just then the hall clock , far off , struck faintly three o'clock . 
I give it as she told it . 
She lay propped in bed , and Halsey sat beside her , unrebuffed , and held her hand while she talked . 
I was not sleeping well , she began , partly , I think , because I had slept during the afternoon . 
Liddy brought me some hot milk at ten o'clock and I slept until twelve . 
Then I wakened and I got to thinking about things , and worrying , so I could not go to sleep . 
I was wondering why I had not heard from Arnold since the since I saw him that night at the lodge . 
I was afraid he was ill , because he was to have done something for me , and he had not come back . 
It must have been three when I heard some one rapping . 
I sat up and listened , to be quite sure , and the rapping kept up . 
It was cautious , and I was about to call Liddy . 
Then suddenly I thought I knew what it was . 
I thought he had come back to see me I didn't think about the time , for his hours were always erratic . 
But I was afraid I was too weak to get down the stairs . 
The knocking kept up , and just as I was about to call Liddy , she ran through the room and out into the hall . 
I got up then , feeling weak and dizzy , and put on my dressing gown . 
If it was Arnold , I knew I must see him . 
It was very dark everywhere , but , of course , I knew my way . 
I felt along for the stair rail , and went down as quickly as I could . 
The knocking had stopped , and I was afraid I was too late . 
I got to the foot of the staircase and over to the door on to the east veranda . 
I had never thought of anything but that it was Arnold , until I reached the door . 
It was unlocked and opened about an inch . 
Everything was black it was perfectly dark outside . 
I felt very queer and shaky . 
Then I thought perhaps Arnold had used his key he did strange things sometimes , and I turned around . 
Just as I reached the foot of the staircase I thought I heard some one coming . 
My nerves were going anyhow , there in the dark , and I could scarcely stand . 
I got up as far as the third or fourth step then I felt that some one was coming toward me on the staircase . 
The next instant a hand met mine on the stair rail . 
Some one brushed past me , and I screamed . 
Then I must have fainted . 
We dispersed finally to bathe and dress , leaving Louise little the worse for her experience . 
But I determined that before the day was over she must know the true state of affairs . 
Another decision I made , and I put it into execution immediately after breakfast . 
The next morning , also , Halsey and I made an exhaustive examination of the circular staircase , the small entry at its foot , and the card room opening from it . 
There was no evidence of anything unusual the night before , and had we not ourselves heard the rapping noises , I should have felt that Louise's imagination had run away with her . 
The outer door was closed and locked , and the staircase curved above us , for all the world like any other staircase . 
Halsey , who had never taken seriously my account of the night Liddy and I were there alone , was grave enough now . 
As nearly as possible I repeated its contents to him , while Halsey took them down in a note book . 
I wish you had told me that before , he said , as he put the memorandum carefully away . 
We found nothing at all in the house , and I expected little from any examination of the porch and grounds . 
But as we opened the outer door something fell into the entry with a clatter . 
It was a cue from the billiard room . 
Halsey picked it up with an exclamation . 
That's careless enough , he said . 
Some of the servants have been amusing themselves . 
I was far from convinced . 
Not one of the servants would go into that wing at night unless driven by dire necessity . 
That afternoon we , Gertrude , Halsey and I , attended the coroner's inquest in town . 
We went , the four of us , in the machine , preferring the execrable roads to the matinee train , with half of Casanova staring at us . 
And on the way we decided to say nothing of Louise and her interview with her stepbrother the night he died . 
The girl was in trouble enough as it was . 
Many things had occurred which were not brought out at the inquest and some things were told there that were new to me . 
Gertrude and I sat well back , with our veils down . 
Mr. Harton was there , too , looking impatient as the inquest dragged , but alive to every particle of evidence . 
From a corner Mr. Jamieson was watching the proceedings intently . 
Doctor Stewart was called first . 
His evidence was told briefly , and amounted to this on the Sunday morning previous , at a quarter before five , he had been called to the telephone . 
The message was from a Mr. Jarvis , who asked him to come at once to Sunnyside , as there had been an accident there , and Mr. Arnold Armstrong had been shot . 
He had dressed hastily , gathered up some instruments , and driven to Sunnyside . 
He was met by Mr. Jarvis , who took him at once to the east wing . 
There , just as he had fallen , was the body of Arnold Armstrong . 
There was no need of the instruments the man was dead . 
In answer to the coroner's question no , the body had not been moved , save to turn it over . 
It lay at the foot of the circular staircase . 
Yes , he believed death had been instantaneous . 
The body was still somewhat warm and rigor mortis had not set in . 
It occurred late in cases of sudden death . 
No , he believed the probability of suicide might be eliminated the wounds could have been self inflicted , but with difficulty , and there had been no weapon found . 
The doctor's examination was over , but he hesitated and cleared his throat . 
The audience was alert at once . 
Kindly proceed , Doctor , the coroner said . 
My home is in Englewood , two miles from Casanova , the doctor began . 
In the absence of Doctor Walker , a number of Casanova people have been consulting me . 
A month ago five weeks , to be exact a woman whom I had never seen came to my office . 
She was in deep mourning and kept her veil down , and she brought for examination a child , a boy of six . 
The little fellow was ill it looked like typhoid , and the mother was frantic . 
She wanted a permit to admit the youngster to the Children's Hospital in town here , where I am a member of the staff , and I gave her one . 
The incident would have escaped me , but for a curious thing . 
Two days before Mr. Armstrong was shot , I was sent for to go to the Country Club some one had been struck with a golf ball that had gone wild . 
It was late when I left I was on foot , and about a mile from the club , on the Claysburg road , I met two people . 
They were disputing violently , and I had no difficulty in recognizing Mr. Armstrong . 
The woman , beyond doubt , was the one who had consulted me about the child . 
At this hint of scandal , Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh sat up very straight . 
Jamieson was looking slightly skeptical , and the coroner made a note . 
The Children's Hospital , you say , Doctor ? he asked . 
But the child , who was entered as Lucien Wallace , was taken away by his mother two weeks ago . 
I have tried to trace them and failed . 
All at once I remembered the telegram sent to Louise by some one signed F. L. W. presumably Doctor Walker . 
Could this veiled woman be the Nina Carrington of the message ? But it was only idle speculation . 
I had no way of finding out , and the inquest was proceeding . 
The report of the coroner's physician came next . 
The left lung was collapsed , and the exit point of the ball had been found in the muscles of the back to the left of the spinal column . 
It was improbable that such a wound had been self inflicted , and its oblique downward course pointed to the fact that the shot had been fired from above . 
There were no marks of powder . 
The bullet , a thirty eight caliber , had been found in the dead man's clothing , and was shown to the jury . 
Mr. Jarvis was called next , but his testimony amounted to little . 
He had been summoned by telephone to Sunnyside , had come over at once with the steward and Mr. Winthrop , at present out of town . 
They had been admitted by the housekeeper , and had found the body lying at the foot of the staircase . 
He had made a search for a weapon , but there was none around . 
The outer entry door in the east wing had been unfastened and was open about an inch . 
I had been growing more and more nervous . 
When the coroner called Mr. John Bailey , the room was filled with suppressed excitement . 
Mr. Jamieson went forward and spoke a few words to the coroner , who nodded . 
He was rather pale , but very composed . 
I stopped there with my automobile for gasolene . 
Mr. Armstrong had been playing cards . 
When I saw him there , he was coming out of the card room , talking to Mr. John Bailey . 
The nature of the discussion was it amicable ? Halsey hesitated . 
They were having a dispute , he said . 
I asked Mr. Bailey to leave the club with me and come to Sunnyside over Sunday . 
At that time had you any suspicion that the Traders' Bank had been wrecked ? No. What occurred next ? Mr. Bailey and I talked in the billiard room until two thirty . 
And Mr. Arnold Armstrong came there , while you were talking ? Yes . 
He came about half past two . 
He rapped at the east door , and I admitted him . 
The silence in the room was intense . 
Mr. Jamieson's eyes never left Halsey's face . 
Will you tell us the nature of his errand ? He brought a telegram that had come to the club for Mr. Bailey . 
He was sober ? Perfectly , at that time . 
Was not his apparent friendliness a change from his former attitude ? Yes . 
I did not understand it . 
How long did he stay ? About five minutes . 
Then he left , by the east entrance . 
What occurred then ? We talked for a few minutes , discussing a plan Mr. Bailey had in mind . 
Then I went to the stables , where I kept my car , and got it out . 
Leaving Mr. Bailey alone in the billiard room ? Halsey hesitated . 
My sister was there ? Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh had the courage to turn and eye Gertrude through her lorgnon . 
And then ? I took the car along the lower road , not to disturb the household . 
Mr. Bailey came down across the lawn , through the hedge , and got into the car on the road . 
Then you know nothing of Mr. Armstrong's movements after he left the house ? Nothing . 
I read of his death Monday evening for the first time . 
Mr. Bailey did not see him on his way across the lawn ? I think not . 
If he had seen him he would have spoken of it . 
Gertrude's replies were fully as concise as Halsey's . 
Mrs. Fitzhugh subjected her to a close inspection , commencing with her hat and ending with her shoes . 
I flatter myself she found nothing wrong with either her gown or her manner , but poor Gertrude's testimony was the reverse of comforting . 
She had been summoned , she said , by her brother , after Mr. Armstrong had gone . 
She had waited in the billiard room with Mr. Bailey , until the automobile had been ready . 
Instead of going at once to her room , she had gone back to the billiard room for something which had been left there . 
The card room and billiard room were in darkness . 
She had thought it was probably her brother , and had been about to go to the door , when she heard it open . 
Almost immediately there was a shot , and she had run panic stricken through the drawing room and had roused the house . 
You heard no other sound ? the coroner asked . 
There was no one with Mr. Armstrong when he entered ? It was perfectly dark . 
There were no voices and I heard nothing . 
There was just the opening of the door , the shot , and the sound of somebody falling . 
Then , while you went through the drawing room and up stairs to alarm the household , the criminal , whoever it was , could have escaped by the east door ? Yes . 
I flatter myself that the coroner got little enough out of me . 
I saw Mr. Jamieson smiling to himself , and the coroner gave me up , after a time . 
At which she turned purple . 
The verdict was that Arnold Armstrong had met his death at the hands of a person or persons unknown , and we all prepared to leave . 
Barbara Fitzhugh flounced out without waiting to speak to me , but Mr. Harton came up , as I knew he would . 
You have decided to give up the house , I hope , Miss Innes , he said . 
Mrs. Armstrong has wired me again . 
I am not going to give it up , I maintained , until I understand some things that are puzzling me . 
The day that the murderer is discovered , I will leave . 
Then , judging by what I have heard , you will be back in the city very soon , he said . 
And I knew that he suspected the discredited cashier of the Traders' Bank . 
Mr. Jamieson came up to me as I was about to leave the coroner's office . 
How is your patient ? he asked with his odd little smile . 
I have no patient , I replied , startled . 
I will put it in a different way , then . 
How is Miss Armstrong ? She she is doing very well , I stammered . 
The ghost is not laid . 
I want you to spend one night at least watching the circular staircase . 
The murder of Arnold Armstrong was a beginning , not an end . 
Perhaps I can do it , he said . 
I have been doing something else , but well , I will come out to night . 
We were very silent during the trip back to Sunnyside . 
I watched Gertrude closely and somewhat sadly . 
To me there was one glaring flaw in her story , and it seemed to stand out for every one to see . 
Arnold Armstrong had had no key , and yet she said she had locked the east door . 
He must have been admitted from within the house over and over I repeated it to myself . 
That night , as gently as I could , I told Louise the story of her stepbrother's death . 
She sat in her big , pillow filled chair , and heard me through without interruption . 
It was clear that she was shocked beyond words if I had hoped to learn anything from her expression , I had failed . 
She was as much in the dark as we were . 
CHAPTER XVIII A HOLE IN THE WALL My taking the detective out to Sunnyside raised an unexpected storm of protest from Gertrude and Halsey . 
I was not prepared for it , and I scarcely knew how to account for it . 
I was glad enough to have him there , when excitements began to come thick and fast . 
Then , too , the return of her mother would mean , of course , that she would have to leave us , and I had become greatly attached to her . 
From the day Mr. Jamieson came to Sunnyside there was a subtle change in Gertrude's manner to me . 
It was elusive , difficult to analyze , but it was there . 
She was no longer frank with me , although I think her affection never wavered . 
At the time I laid the change to the fact that I had forbidden all communication with John Bailey , and had refused to acknowledge any engagement between the two . 
Gertrude spent much of her time wandering through the grounds , or taking long cross country walks . 
Halsey played golf at the Country Club day after day , and after Louise left , as she did the following week , Mr. Jamieson and I were much together . 
He played a fair game of cribbage , but he cheated at solitaire . 
The night the detective arrived , Saturday , I had a talk with him . 
I told him of the experience Louise Armstrong had had the night before , on the circular staircase , and about the man who had so frightened Rosie on the drive . 
I saw that he thought the information was important , and to my suggestion that we put an additional lock on the east wing door he opposed a strong negative . 
Then I can watch for at least a part of each night and probably Mr. Innes will help us out . 
I would say as little to Thomas as possible . 
The old man knows more than he is willing to admit . 
I suggested that Alex , the gardener , would probably be willing to help , and Mr. Jamieson undertook to make the arrangement . 
For one night , however , Mr. Jamieson preferred to watch alone . 
The detective sat in absolute darkness on the lower step of the stairs , dozing , he said afterwards , now and then . 
Nothing could pass him in either direction , and the door in the morning remained as securely fastened as it had been the night before . 
And yet one of the most inexplicable occurrences of the whole affair took place that very night . 
Liddy came to my room on Sunday morning with a face as long as the moral law . 
She laid out my , things as usual , but I missed her customary garrulousness . 
I was not regaled with the new cook's extravagance as to eggs , and she even forbore to mention that Jamieson , on whose arrival she had looked with silent disfavor . 
What's the matter , Liddy ? I asked at last . 
Didn't you sleep last night ? No , ma'm , she said stiffly . 
Did you have two cups of coffee at your dinner ? I inquired . 
No , ma'm , indignantly . 
I sat up and almost upset my hot water I always take a cup of hot water with a pinch of salt , before I get up . 
Liddy Allen , I said , stop combing that switch and tell me what is wrong with you . 
Who packed it ? I asked , expecting from her tone to be told she had wakened to find it done by some ghostly hand . 
I did Miss Rachel , you won't believe me when I tell you this house is haunted . 
Who was it fell down the clothes chute ? Who was it scared Miss Louise almost into her grave ? I'm doing my best to find out , I said . 
What in the world are you driving at ? She drew a long breath . 
There is a hole in the trunk room wall , dug out since last night . 
It's big enough to put your head in , and the plaster's all over the place . 
Just ask Alex , she said . 
When he put the new cook's trunk there last night the wall was as smooth as this . 
This morning it's dug out , and there's plaster on the cook's trunk . 
Miss Rachel , you can get a dozen detectives and put one on every stair in the house , and you'll never catch anything . 
There's some things you can't handcuff . 
As soon as I could , I went up to the trunk room , which was directly over my bedroom . 
The plan of the upper story of the house was like that of the second floor , in the main . 
One end , however , over the east wing , had been left only roughly finished , the intention having been to convert it into a ball room at some future time . 
The maids' rooms , trunk room , and various store rooms , including a large airy linen room , opened from a long corridor , like that on the second floor . 
And in the trunk room , as Liddy had said , was a fresh break in the plaster . 
Not only in the plaster , but through the lathing , the aperture extended . 
I reached into the opening , and three feet away , perhaps , I could touch the bricks of the partition wall . 
You are sure the hole was not here yesterday ? I asked Liddy , whose expression was a mixture of satisfaction and alarm . 
In answer she pointed to the new cook's trunk that necessary adjunct of the migratory domestic . 
The top was covered with fine white plaster , as was the floor . 
But there were no large pieces of mortar lying around no bits of lathing . 
When I mentioned this to Liddy she merely raised her eyebrows . 
Being quite confident that the gap was of unholy origin , she did not concern herself with such trifles as a bit of mortar and lath . 
No doubt they were even then heaped neatly on a gravestone in the Casanova churchyard ! I brought Mr. Jamieson up to see the hole in the wall , directly after breakfast . 
His expression was very odd when he looked at it , and the first thing he did was to try to discover what object , if any , such a hole could have . 
He got a piece of candle , and by enlarging the aperture a little was able to examine what lay beyond . 
The trunk room , although heated by steam heat , like the rest of the house , boasted of a fireplace and mantel as well . 
The opening had been made between the flue and the outer wall of the house . 
The breach had been made about four feet from the floor , and inside were all the missing bits of plaster . 
It had been a methodical ghost . 
It was very much of a disappointment . 
I had expected a secret room , at the very least , and I think even Mr. Jamieson had fancied he might at last have a clue to the mystery . 
There was evidently nothing more to be discovered Liddy reported that everything was serene among the servants , and that none of them had been disturbed by the noise . 
Halsey was inclined to pooh pooh the whole affair . 
He said a break in the plaster might have occurred months ago and gone unnoticed , and that the dust had probably been stirred up the day before . 
After all , we had to let it go at that , but we put in an uncomfortable Sunday . 
Gertrude went to church , and Halsey took a long walk in the morning . 
Louise was able to sit up , and she allowed Halsey and Liddy to assist her down stairs late in the afternoon . 
The east veranda was shady , green with vines and palms , cheerful with cushions and lounging chairs . 
We put Louise in a steamer chair , and she sat there passively enough , her hands clasped in her lap . 
Halsey sat on the rail with a pipe , openly watching Louise , as she looked broodingly across the valley to the hills . 
There was something baffling in the girl's eyes and gradually Halsey's boyish features lost their glow at seeing her about again , and settled into grim lines . 
He was like his father just then . 
We sat until late afternoon , Halsey growing more and more moody . 
Shortly before six , he got up and went into the house , and in a few minutes he came out and called me to the telephone . 
When I finished , Liddy was behind me , her mouth a thin line . 
I wish you would try to look cheerful , Liddy , I groaned , your face would sour milk . 
But Liddy seldom replied to my gibes . 
She folded her lips a little tighter . 
He called her up , she said oracularly , he called her up , and asked her to keep you at the telephone , so he could talk to Miss Louise . 
A THANKLESS CHILD IS SHARPER THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH . 
Nonsense ! I said bruskly . 
I might have known enough to leave them . 
It's a long time since you and I were in love , Liddy , and we forget . 
No man ever , made a fool of me , she replied virtuously . 
Well , something did , I retorted . 
It developed nothing new beyond the story of Doctor Stewart's , and that was volunteered . 
An inquest is only a necessary formality , Miss Innes , he replied . 
Unless a crime is committed in the open , the inquest does nothing beyond getting evidence from witnesses while events are still in their minds . 
The police step in later . 
You and I both know how many important things never transpired . 
For instance the dead man had no key , and yet Miss Gertrude testified to a fumbling at the lock , and then the opening of the door . 
Behold , says the doctor , they are one and the same . 
Why was Mr. Bailey not present at the inquest ? The detective's expression was peculiar . 
Because his physician testified that he is ill , and unable to leave his bed . 
Why , neither Halsey nor Gertrude has told me that . 
There are more things than that , Miss Innes , that are puzzling . 
Bailey gives the impression that he knew nothing of the crash at the bank until he read it in the paper Monday night , and that he went back and surrendered himself immediately . 
I do not believe it . 
Jonas , the watchman at the Traders' Bank , tells a different story . 
He says that on the Thursday night before , about eight thirty , Bailey went back to the bank . 
Jonas admitted him , and he says the cashier was in a state almost of collapse . 
Bailey worked until midnight , then he closed the vault and went away . 
The occurrence was so unusual that the watchman pondered over it an the rest of the night . 
What did Bailey do when he went back to the Knickerbocker apartments that night ? He packed a suit case ready for instant departure . 
But he held off too long he waited for something . 
My personal opinion is that he waited to see Miss Gertrude before flying from the country . 
Then , when he had shot down Arnold Armstrong that night , he had to choose between two evils . 
He did the thing that would immediately turn public opinion in his favor , and surrendered himself , as an innocent man . 
The strongest thing against him is his preparation for flight , and his deciding to come back after the murder of Arnold Armstrong . 
He was shrewd enough to disarm suspicion as to the graver charge ? The evening dragged along slowly . 
Mrs. Watson came to my bedroom before I went to bed and asked if I had any arnica . 
It looked to me as if it might be serious , and I told her to let Doctor Stewart see it . 
The next morning Mrs. Watson went up to town on the eleven train , and was admitted to the Charity Hospital . 
She was suffering from blood poisoning . 
I fully meant to go up and see her there , but other things drove her entirely from my mind . 
I telephoned to the hospital that day , however , and ordered a private room for her , and whatever comforts she might be allowed . 
Mrs. Armstrong arrived Monday evening with her husband's body , and the services were set for the next day . 
The house on Chestnut Street , in town , had been opened , and Tuesday morning Louise left us to go home . 
She sent for me before she went , and I saw she had been crying . 
How can I thank you , Miss Innes ? she said . 
You have taken me on faith , and you have not asked me any questions . 
Some time , perhaps , I can tell you and when that time comes , you will all despise me , Halsey , too . 
I tried to tell her how glad I was to have had her but there was something else she wanted to say . 
She said it finally , when she had bade a constrained good by to Halsey and the car was waiting at the door . 
I am afraid to have you stay . 
Gertrude went into town with her and saw her safely home . 
She reported a decided coolness in the greeting between Louise and her mother , and that Doctor Walker was there , apparently in charge of the arrangements for the funeral . 
Halsey disappeared shortly after Louise left and came home about nine that night , muddy and tired . 
As for Thomas , he went around dejected and sad , and I saw the detective watching him closely at dinner . 
Even now I wonder what did Thomas know ? What did he suspect ? At ten o'clock the household had settled down for the night . 
Liddy , who was taking Mrs. Watson's place , had finished examining the tea towels and the corners of the shelves in the cooling room , and had gone to bed . 
Alex , the gardener , had gone heavily up the circular staircase to his room , and Mr. Jamieson was examining the locks of the windows . 
Halsey dropped into a chair in the living room , and stared moodily ahead . 
What sort of a looking chap is that Walker , Gertrude ? he asked ! Rather tall , very dark , smooth shaven . 
Not bad looking , Gertrude said , putting down the book she had been pretending to read . 
Halsey kicked a taboret viciously . 
Lovely place this village must be in the winter , he said irrelevantly . 
A girl would be buried alive here . 
It was then some one rapped at the knocker on the heavy front door . 
Halsey got up leisurely and opened it , admitting Warner . 
He was out of breath from running , and he looked half abashed . 
I am sorry to disturb you , he said . 
But I didn't know what else to do . 
What about Thomas ? I asked . 
Mr. Jamieson had come into the hall and we all stared at Warner . 
He's acting queer , Warner explained . 
He's sitting down there on the edge of the porch , and he says he has seen a ghost . 
The old man looks bad , too he can scarcely speak . 
He's as full of superstition as an egg is of meat , I said . 
Halsey , bring some whisky and we will all go down . 
No one moved to get the whisky , from which I judged there were three pocket flasks ready for emergency . 
Gertrude threw a shawl around my shoulders , and we all started down over the hill I had made so many nocturnal excursions around the place that I knew my way perfectly . 
But Thomas was not on the veranda , nor was he inside the house . 
The men exchanged significant glances , and Warner got a lantern . 
He can't have gone far , he said . 
He was trembling so that he couldn't stand , when I left . 
Jamieson and Halsey together made the round of the lodge , occasionally calling the old man by name . 
But there was no response . 
No Thomas came , bowing and showing his white teeth through the darkness . 
I began to be vaguely uneasy , for the first time . 
He came around to the edge of the veranda and stood looking at it as if it ought to know and explain . 
He might have stumbled into the house , he said , but he could not have climbed the stairs . 
Anyhow , he's not inside or outside , that I can see . 
The other members of the party had come back now , and no one had found any trace of the old man . 
His pipe , still warm , rested on the edge of the rail , and inside on the table his old gray hat showed that its owner had not gone far . 
He was not far , after all . 
From the table my eyes traveled around the room , and stopped at the door of a closet . 
I hardly know what impulse moved me , but I went in and turned the knob . 
It burst open with the impetus of a weight behind it , and something fell partly forward in a heap on the floor . 
It was Thomas Thomas without a mark of injury on him , and dead . 
CHAPTER XX DOCTOR WALKER'S WARNING Warner was on his knees in a moment , fumbling at the old man's collar to loosen it , but Halsey caught his hand . 
Let him alone ? he said . 
You can't help him he is dead . 
When Mr. Jamieson had finished his cursory examination , he got up and dusted the knees of his trousers . 
There is no sign of injury , he said , and I know I , for one , drew a long breath of relief . 
From what Warner says and from his hiding in the closet , I should say he was scared to death . 
Fright and a weak heart , together . 
But what could have done it ? Gertrude asked . 
He was all right this evening at dinner . 
Warner , what did he say when you found him on the porch ? Warner looked shaken his honest , boyish face was colorless . 
Just what I told you , Miss Innes . 
He'd been reading the paper down stairs I had put up the car , and , feeling sleepy , I came down to the lodge to go to bed . 
As I went up stairs , Thomas put down the paper and , taking his pipe , went out on the porch . 
Then I heard an exclamation from him . 
What did he say ? demanded Jamieson . 
I couldn't hear , but his voice was strange it sounded startled . 
I waited for him to call out again , but he did not , so I went down stairs . 
He was sitting on the porch step , looking straight ahead , as if he saw something among the trees across the road . 
And he kept mumbling about having seen a ghost . 
He looked queer , and I tried to get him inside , but he wouldn't move . 
Then I thought I'd better go up to the house . 
Didn't he say anything else you could understand ? I asked . 
He said something about the grave giving up its dead . 
Mr. Jamieson was going through the old man's pockets , and Gertrude was composing his arms , folding them across his white shirt bosom , always so spotless . 
Mr. Jamieson looked up at me . 
Here he found some things that interested him . 
Mr. Jamieson read it then he gave it to me . 
It was an address in fresh ink LUCIEN WALLACE , Elm Street , Richfield . 
As the card went around , I think both the detective and I watched for any possible effect it might have , but , beyond perplexity , there seemed to be none . 
Why , Elm Street is the main street don't you remember , Halsey ? Lucien Wallace ! Halsey said . 
That is the child Stewart spoke of at the inquest . 
Warner , with his mechanic's instinct , had reached for the key . 
What he said was not a surprise . 
Yale lock , he said . 
Probably a key to the east entry . 
There was no reason why Thomas , an old and trusted servant , should not have had a key to that particular door , although the servants' entry was in the west wing . 
But I had not known of this key , and it opened up a new field of conjecture . 
Just now , however , there were many things to be attended to , and , leaving Warner with the body , we all went back to the house . 
Mr. Jamieson walked with me , while Halsey and Gertrude followed . 
I suppose I shall have to notify the Armstrongs , I said . 
They will know if Thomas had any people and how to reach them . 
Of course , I expect to defray the expenses of the funeral , but his relatives must be found . 
I am sorry in more than one way I have always believed that Thomas knew something , or suspected something , that he would not tell . 
Do you know hour much money there was in that worn out wallet of his ? Nearly a hundred dollars ! Almost two months' wages and yet those darkies seldom have a penny . 
Well what Thomas knew will be buried with him . 
Halsey suggested that the grounds be searched , but Mr. Jamieson vetoed the suggestion . 
You would find nothing , he said . 
With the death of Thomas , I felt that a climax had come in affairs at Sunnyside . 
The night that followed was quiet enough . 
Halsey watched at the foot of the staircase , and a complicated system of bolts on the other doors seemed to be effectual . 
Once in the night I wakened and thought I heard the tapping again . 
But all was quiet , and I had reached the stage where I refused to be disturbed for minor occurrences . 
The Armstrongs were notified of Thomas' death , and I had my first interview with Doctor Walker as a result . 
He came up early the next morning , just as we finished breakfast , in a professional looking car with a black hood . 
I found him striding up and down the living room , and , in spite of my preconceived dislike , I had to admit that the man was presentable . 
A big fellow he was , tall and dark , as Gertrude had said , smooth shaven and erect , with prominent features and a square jaw . 
He was painfully spruce in his appearance , and his manner was almost obtrusively polite . 
I must make a double excuse for this early visit , Miss Innes , he said as he sat down . 
The chair was lower than he expected , and his dignity required collecting before he went on . 
My professional duties are urgent and long neglected , and a fall to the every day manner something must be done about that body . 
Yes , I said , sitting on the edge of my chair . 
I merely wished the address of Thomas' people . 
You might have telephoned , if you were busy . 
I wished to see you about something else , he said . 
As for Thomas , it is Mrs. Armstrong's wish that would allow her to attend to the expense . 
About his relatives , I have already notified his brother , in the village . 
It was heart disease , I think . 
Thomas always had a bad heart . 
Heart disease and fright , I said , still on the edge of my chair . 
But the doctor had no intention of leaving . 
I understand you have a ghost up here , and that you have the house filled with detectives to exorcise it , he said . 
For some reason I felt I was being pumped , as Halsey says . 
You have been misinformed , I replied . 
What , no ghost , no detectives ! he said , still with his smile . 
What a disappointment to the village ! I resented his attempt at playfulness . 
It had been anything but a joke to us . 
Doctor Walker , I said tartly , I fail to see any humor in the situation . 
Since I came here , one man has been shot , and another one has died from shock . 
There have been intruders in the house , and strange noises . 
If that is funny , there is something wrong with my sense of humor . 
You miss the point , he said , still good naturedly . 
The thing that is funny , to me , is that you insist on remaining here , under the circumstances . 
I should think nothing would keep you . 
Everything that occurs only confirms my resolution to stay until the mystery is cleared . 
I have a message for you , Miss Innes , he said , rising at last . 
Mrs. Armstrong asked me to thank you for your kindness to Louise , whose whim , occurring at the time it did , put her to great inconvenience . 
Sunnyside is her home she loves it dearly , and just now she wishes to retire here for quiet and peace . 
She must have had a change of heart , I said , ungraciously enough . 
Louise told me her mother despised the place . 
Besides , this is no place for quiet and peace just now . 
Anyhow , doctor , while I don't care to force an issue , I shall certainly remain here , for a time at least . 
For how long ? he asked . 
My lease is for six months . 
I shall stay until some explanation is found for certain things . 
My own family is implicated now , and I shall do everything to clear the mystery of Arnold Armstrong's murder . 
The doctor stood looking down , slapping his gloves thoughtfully against the palm of a well looked after hand . 
You say there have been intruders in the house ? he asked . 
You are sure of that , Miss Innes ? Certain . 
In what part ? In the east wing . 
Can you tell me when these intrusions occurred , and what the purpose seemed to be ? Was it robbery ? No , I said decidedly . 
As to time , once on Friday night a week ago , again the following night , when Arnold Armstrong was murdered , and again last Friday night . 
He seemed to be debating some question in his mind , and to reach a decision . 
I'm not a croaker , but take a warning . 
Leave before anything occurs that will cause you a lifelong regret . 
I am willing to take the responsibility , I said coldly . 
I think he gave me up then as a poor proposition . 
He asked to be shown where Arnold Armstrong's body had been found , and I took him there . 
He scrutinized the whole place carefully , examining the stairs and the lock . 
When he had taken a formal farewell I was confident of one thing . 
Doctor Walker would do anything he could to get me away from Sunnyside . 
CHAPTER XXI FOURTEEN ELM STREET It was Monday evening when we found the body of poor old Thomas . 
Monday night had been uneventful things were quiet at the house and the peculiar circumstances of the old man's death had been carefully kept from the servants . 
Rosie took charge of the dining room and pantry , in the absence of a butler , and , except for the warning of the Casanova doctor , everything breathed of peace . 
Affairs at the Traders' Bank were progressing slowly . 
The failure had hit small stock holders very hard , the minister of the little Methodist chapel in Casanova among them . 
A few days after the services he called to see me , a kind faced little man , in a very bad frock coat and laundered tie . 
I think he was uncertain as to my connection with the Armstrong family , and dubious whether I considered Mr. Armstrong's taking away a matter for condolence or congratulation . 
He was not long in doubt . 
I liked the little man . 
He had known Thomas well , and had promised to officiate at the services in the rickety African Zion Church . 
He told me more of himself than he knew , and before he left , I astonished him and myself , I admit by promising a new carpet for his church . 
He was much affected , and I gathered that he had yearned over his ragged chapel as a mother over a half clothed child . 
You are laying up treasure , Miss Innes , he said brokenly , where neither moth nor rust corrupt , nor thieves break through and steal . 
It is certainly a safer place than Sunnyside , I admitted . 
And the thought of the carpet permitted him to smile . 
He stood just inside the doorway , looking from the luxury of the house to the beauty of the view . 
The rich ought to be good , he said wistfully . 
They have so much that is beautiful , and beauty is ennobling . 
And yet while I ought to say nothing but good of the dead Mr. Armstrong saw nothing of this fair prospect . 
To him these trees and lawns were not the work of God . 
They were property , at so much an acre . 
He loved money , Miss Innes . 
He offered up everything to his golden calf . 
Not power , not ambition , was his fetish it was money . 
Unlike the summer people , he gave neither to the poor nor to the church . 
He loved money for its own sake . 
And there are no pockets in shrouds ! I said cynically . 
I sent him home in the car , with a bunch of hot house roses for his wife , and he was quite overwhelmed . 
As for me , I had a generous glow that was cheap at the price of a church carpet . 
I received less gratification and less gratitude when I presented the new silver communion set to St . 
I had a great many things to think about in those days . 
I made out a list of questions and possible answers , but I seemed only to be working around in a circle . 
I always ended where I began . 
Why did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left the house the night he was killed ? No answer . 
Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned ? Who admitted him ? Gertrude said she had looked the east entry . 
There was no key on the dead man or in the door . 
He must have been admitted from within . 
Who had been locked in the clothes chute ? Some one unfamiliar with the house , evidently . 
Only two people missing from the household , Rosie and Gertrude . 
Rosie had been at the lodge . 
Therefore but was it Gertrude ? Might it not have been the mysterious intruder again ? Who had accosted Rosie on the drive ? Again perhaps the nightly visitor . 
It seemed more likely some one who suspected a secret at the lodge . 
Was Louise under surveillance ? Who had passed Louise on the circular staircase ? Could it have been Thomas ? The key to the east entry made this a possibility . 
But why was he there , if it were indeed he ? Who had made the hole in the trunk room wall ? It was not vandalism . 
It had been done quietly , and with deliberate purpose . 
The firm of expert accountants who had examined the books some two months before testified that every bond , every piece of valuable paper , was there at that time . 
It had been shortly after their examination that the president , who had been in bad health , had gone to California . 
Mr. Bailey was still ill at the Knickerbocker , and in this , as in other ways , Gertrude's conduct puzzled me . 
She seemed indifferent , refused to discuss matters pertaining to the bank , and never , to my knowledge , either wrote to him or went to see him . 
Girls in my day did not meekly accept the public's verdict as to the man they loved . 
But presently something occurred that made me think that under Gertrude's surface calm there was a seething flood of emotions . 
Tuesday morning the detective made a careful search of the grounds , but he found nothing . 
In the afternoon he disappeared , and it was late that night when he came home . 
He said he would have to go back to the city the following day , and arranged with Halsey and Alex to guard the house . 
Liddy came to me on Wednesday morning with her black silk apron held up like a bag , and her eyes big with virtuous wrath . 
It was the day of Thomas' funeral in the village , and Alex and I were in the conservatory cutting flowers for the old man's casket . 
Liddy is never so happy as when she is making herself wretched , and now her mouth drooped while her eyes were triumphant . 
I always said there were plenty of things going on here , right under our noses , that we couldn't see , she said , holding out her apron . 
I don't see with my nose , I remarked . 
Alex had stepped back , but I saw him watching her curiously . 
Wait a moment , Liddy , I said . 
You have been going through the library paper basket again ! Liddy was arranging her bits of paper with the skill of long practice and paid no attention . 
More than that , with things happening every day , I consider it my duty . 
If you don't read and act on this , I shall give it to that Jamieson , and I'll venture he'll not go back to the city to day . 
If the scraps had anything to do with the mystery ordinary conventions had no value . 
So Liddy arranged the scraps , like working out one of the puzzle pictures children play with , and she did it with much the same eagerness . 
When it was finished she stepped aside while I read it . 
Wednesday night , nine o'clock . 
Bridge , I real aloud . 
Then , aware of Alex's stare , I turned on Liddy . 
Some one is to play bridge to night at nine o'clock , I said . 
Is that your business , or mine ? Liddy was aggrieved . 
She was about to reply when I scooped up the pieces and left the conservatory . 
Now then , I said , when we got outside , will you tell me why you choose to take Alex into your confidence ? He's no fool . 
Nobody knows it , Liddy said humbly . 
I found it in the basket in Miss Gertrude's dressing room . 
Look at the back of the sheet . 
I turned over some of the scraps , and , sure enough , it was a blank deposit slip from the Traders' Bank . 
I decided to make certain , however , by going to the bridge that night . 
After luncheon Mr. Jamieson suggested that I go with him to Richfield , and I consented . 
I am inclined to place more faith in Doctor Stewart's story , he said , since I found that scrap in old Thomas' pocket . 
It bears out the statement that the woman with the child , and the woman who quarreled with Armstrong , are the same . 
Then , you see , your story about the woman at the card room window begins to mean something . 
It is the nearest approach to anything tangible that we have had yet . 
Warner took us to Richfield in the car . 
It was about twenty five miles by railroad , but by taking a series of atrociously rough short cuts we got there very quickly . 
Elm Street was almost the only street , and number fourteen was easily found . 
It was a small white house , dilapidated without having gained anything picturesque , with a low window and a porch only a foot or so above the bit of a lawn . 
There was a baby carriage in the path , and from a swing at the side came the sound of conflict . 
Three small children were disputing vociferously , and a faded young woman with a kindly face was trying to hush the clamor . 
When she saw us she untied her gingham apron and came around to the porch . 
Good afternoon , I said . 
Jamieson lifted his hat , without speaking . 
I came to inquire about a child named Lucien Wallace . 
I am glad you have come , she said . 
In spite of the other children , I think the little fellow is lonely . 
We thought perhaps his mother would be here to day . 
You are Mrs. Tate ? I wondered how the detective knew . 
Mrs. Tate , we want to make some inquiries . 
Perhaps in the house Come right in , she said hospitably . 
And soon we were in the little shabby parlor , exactly like a thousand of its prototypes . 
Mrs. Tate sat uneasily , her hands folded in her lap . 
How long has Lucien been here ? Mr. Jamieson asked . 
Since a week ago last Friday . 
His mother paid one week's board in advance the other has not been paid . 
Was he ill when he came ? No , sir , not what you'd call sick . 
He was getting better of typhoid , she said , and he's picking up fine . 
Will you tell me his mother's name and address ? That's the trouble , the young woman said , knitting her brows . 
She gave her name as Mrs. Wallace , and said she had no address . 
She was looking for a boarding house in town . 
She said she worked in a department store , and couldn't take care of the child properly , and he needed fresh air and milk . 
I had three children of my own , and one more didn't make much difference in the work , but I wish she would pay this week's board . 
Did she say what store it was ? No , sir , but all the boy's clothes came from King's . 
He has far too fine clothes for the country . 
Whoa , Flinders , he shouted . 
You're goin' to smash the trap . 
Mr. Jamieson coaxed him over by holding out a lead pencil , striped blue and yellow . 
Great ! And what's your mother's name ? Mother , of course . 
What's your mother's name ? And he pointed to me ! I am going to stop wearing black it doubles a woman's age . 
And where did you live before you came here ? The detective was polite enough not to smile . 
And I saw Mr. Jamieson's eyebrows go up . 
Well , young man , you don't seem to know much about yourself . 
I've tried it all week , Mrs. Tate broke in . 
The boy knows a word or two of German , but he doesn't know where he lived , or anything about himself . 
Mr. Jamieson wrote something on a card and gave it to her . 
Mrs. Tate , he said , I want you to do something . 
Here is some money for the telephone call . 
The instant the boy's mother appears here , call up that number and ask for the person whose name is there . 
You can run across to the drug store on an errand and do it quietly . 
Just say , The lady has come . 
The lady has come , repeated Mrs. Tate . 
Very well , sir , and I hope it will be soon . 
The milk bill alone is almost double what it was . 
How much is the child's board ? I asked . 
Three dollars a week , including his washing . 
Very well , I said . 
Now , Mrs. Tate , I am going to pay last week's board and a week in advance . 
Her tired , faded face lighted up , and I saw her glance at the little Tates' small feet . 
Shoes , I divined the feet of the genteel poor being almost as expensive as their stomachs . 
As we went back Mr. Jamieson made only one remark I think he was laboring under the weight of a great disappointment . 
Is King's a children's outfitting place ? he asked . 
It is a general department store . 
He was silent after that , but he went to the telephone as soon as we got home , and called up King and Company , in the city . 
After a time he got the general manager , and they talked for some time . 
When Mr. Jamieson hung up the receiver he turned to me . 
The plot thickens , he said with his ready smile . 
There are four women named Wallace at King's none of them married , and none over twenty . 
I think I shall go up to the city to night . 
I want to go to the Children's Hospital . 
But before I go , Miss Innes , I wish you would be more frank with me than you have been yet . 
I want you to show me the revolver you picked up in the tulip bed . 
So he had known all along ! It WAS a revolver , Mr. Jamieson , I admitted , cornered at last , but I can not show it to you . 
It is not in my possession . 
I sat and knitted , pretending not to notice when Gertrude got up and wandered out into the starlight . 
As soon as I was satisfied that she had gone , however , I went out cautiously . 
I had no intention of eavesdropping , but I wanted to be certain that it was Jack Bailey she was meeting . 
Too many things had occurred in which Gertrude was , or appeared to be , involved , to allow anything to be left in question . 
I went slowly across the lawn , skirted the hedge to a break not far from the lodge , and found myself on the open road . 
Perhaps a hundred feet to the left the path led across the valley to the Country Club , and only a little way off was the foot bridge over Casanova Creek . 
But just as I was about to turn down the path I heard steps coming toward me , and I shrank into the bushes . 
It was Gertrude , going back quickly toward the house . 
I waited until she had had time to get almost to the house before I started . 
And then I stepped back again into the shadows . 
The reason why Gertrude had not kept her tryst was evident . 
Leaning on the parapet of the bridge in the moonlight , and smoking a pipe , was Alex , the gardener . 
I could have throttled Liddy for her carelessness in reading the torn note where he could hear . 
And I could cheerfully have choked Alex to death for his audacity . 
But there was no help for it I turned and followed Gertrude slowly back to the house . 
The frequent invasions of the house had effectually prevented any relaxation after dusk . 
To provide only one possible entrance for the invader , and to keep a constant guard in the dark at the foot of the circular staircase , seemed to be the only method . 
In the absence of the detective , Alex and Halsey arranged to change off , Halsey to be on duty from ten to two , and Alex from two until six . 
The house was quiet again Wednesday night . 
It was almost a week since Louise had encountered some one on the stairs , and it was four days since the discovery of the hole in the trunk room wall . 
Louise was with her mother in town , and , beyond a polite note of thanks to me , we had heard nothing from her . 
Doctor Walker had taken up his practice again , and we saw him now and then flying past along the road , always at top speed . 
The murder of Arnold Armstrong was still unavenged , and I remained firm in the position I had taken to stay at Sunnyside until the thing was at least partly cleared . 
And yet , for all its quiet , it was on Wednesday night that perhaps the boldest attempt was made to enter the house . 
On Thursday afternoon the laundress sent word she would like to speak to me , and I saw her in my private sitting room , a small room beyond the dressing room . 
She had rolled down her sleeves and tied a white apron around her waist , and she stood making folds in it with fingers that were red and shiny from her soap suds . 
Well , Mary , I said encouragingly , what's the matter ? Don't dare to tell me the soap is out . 
No , ma'm , Miss Innes . 
I was askin' did you want the ladder left up the clothes chute ? The what ? I screeched , and was sorry the next minute . 
Seeing her suspicions were verified , Mary Anne had gone white , and stood with her eyes shifting more wildly than ever . 
There's a ladder up the clothes chute , Miss Innes , she said . 
It's up that tight I can't move it , and I didn't like to ask for help until I spoke to you . 
It was useless to dissemble Mary Anne knew now as well as I did that the ladder had no business to be there . 
I did the best I could , however . 
I put her on the defensive at once . 
Then you didn't lock the laundry last night ? I locked it tight , and put the key in the kitchen on its nail . 
Very well , then you forgot a window . 
Yes'm , she said at last . 
I thought I locked them all , but there was one open this morning . 
I went out of the room and down the hall , followed by Mary Anne . 
The door into the clothes chute was securely bolted , and when I opened it I saw the evidence of the woman's story . 
This is due to your carelessness , I said . 
If we had all been murdered in our beds it would have been your fault . 
Now , not a word of this through the house , and send Alex to me . 
The effect on Alex was to make him apoplectic with rage , and with it all I fancied there was an element of satisfaction . 
As I look back , so many things are plain to me that I wonder I could not see at the time . 
It is all known now , and yet the whole thing was so remarkable that perhaps my stupidity was excusable . 
Alex leaned down the chute and examined the ladder carefully . 
It is caught , he said with a grim smile . 
The fools , to have left a warning like that ! The only trouble is , Miss Innes , they won't be apt to come back for a while . 
I shouldn't regard that in the light of a calamity , I replied . 
Until late that evening Halsey and Alex worked at the chute . 
They forced down the ladder at last , and put a new bolt on the door . 
As for myself , I sat and wondered if I had a deadly enemy , intent on my destruction . 
I was growing more and more nervous . 
That was the way things stood that Thursday night , when I myself took a hand in the struggle . 
Gertrude had been sitting staring in front of her , jumping at every sound . 
Now she turned on Liddy pettishly . 
I declare , Liddy , she said , you are a bundle of nerves . 
What if Eliza did see some men around the stable ? It may have been Warner and Alex . 
Warner is in the kitchen , miss , Liddy said with dignity . 
And if you had come through what I have , you would be a bundle of nerves , too . 
Miss Rachel , I'd be thankful if you'd give me my month's wages to morrow . 
I'll be going to my sister's . 
Very well , I said , to her evident amazement . 
I will make out the check . 
Warner can take you down to the noon train . 
Liddy's face was really funny . 
You'll have a nice time at your sister's , I went on . 
Five children , hasn't she ? That's it , Liddy said , suddenly bursting into tears . 
Send me away , after all these years , and your new shawl only half done , and nobody knowin' how to fix the water for your bath . 
It's time I learned to prepare my own bath . 
But Gertrude got up and put her arms around Liddy's shaking shoulders . 
You are two big babies , she said soothingly . 
Neither one of you could get along for an hour without the other . 
So stop quarreling and be good . 
Liddy , go right up and lay out Aunty's night things . 
She is going to bed early . 
After Liddy had gone I began to think about the men at the stable , and I grew more and more anxious . 
Halsey was aimlessly knocking the billiard balls around in the billiard room , and I called to him . 
Halsey , I said when he sauntered in , is there a policeman in Casanova ? Constable , he said laconically . 
Veteran of the war , one arm in office to conciliate the G. A. R. element . 
Why ? Because I am uneasy to night . 
And I told him what Liddy had said . 
It wouldn't be a bad scheme . 
He's a smart darky , and with his mouth shut and his shirt front covered , you couldn't see him a yard off in the dark . 
Halsey conferred with Alex , and the result , in an hour , was Sam . 
There had been numerous attempts to break into the house it was the intention , not to drive intruders away , but to capture them . 
If Sam saw anything suspicious outside , he was to tap at the east entry , where Alex and Halsey were to alternate in keeping watch through the night . 
It was with a comfortable feeling of security that I went to bed that night . 
The door between Gertrude's rooms and mine had been opened , and , with the doors into the hall bolted , we were safe enough . 
Although Liddy persisted in her belief that doors would prove no obstacles to our disturbers . 
As before , Halsey watched the east entry from ten until two . 
He had an eye to comfort , and he kept vigil in a heavy oak chair , very large and deep . 
We went up stairs rather early , and through the open door Gertrude and I kept up a running fire of conversation . 
Liddy was brushing my hair , and Gertrude was doing her own , with a long free sweep of her strong round arms . 
Did you know Mrs. Armstrong and Louise are in the village ? she called . 
No , I replied , startled . 
How did you hear it ? I met the oldest Stewart girl to day , the doctor's daughter , and she told me they had not gone back to town after the funeral . 
They went directly to that little yellow house next to Doctor Walker's , and are apparently settled there . 
They took the house furnished for the summer . 
Why , it's a bandbox , I said . 
I can't imagine Fanny Armstrong in such a place . 
Ella Stewart says Mrs. Armstrong has aged terribly , and looks as if she is hardly able to walk . 
I lay and thought over some of these things until midnight . 
Apparently only a few minutes elapsed , during which my eyes were becoming accustomed to the darkness . 
Then I noticed that the windows were reflecting a faint pinkish light , Liddy noticed it at the same time , and I heard her jump up . 
At that moment Sam's deep voice boomed from somewhere just below . 
The stable's on fire ! I could see him in the glare dancing up and down on the drive , and a moment later Halsey joined him . 
Gertrude seldom loses her presence of mind , and she ran to the telephone . 
But by the time the Casanova volunteer fire department came toiling up the hill the stable was a furnace , with the Dragon Fly safe but blistered , in the road . 
Some gasolene exploded just as the volunteer department got to work , which shook their nerves as well as the burning building . 
The stable , being on a hill , was a torch to attract the population from every direction . 
Rumor had it that Sunnyside was burning , and it was amazing how many people threw something over their night clothes and flew to the conflagration . 
I take it Casanova has few fires , and Sunnyside was furnishing the people , in one way and another , the greatest excitement they had had for years . 
The stable was off the west wing . 
I hardly know how I came to think of the circular staircase and the unguarded door at its foot . 
Liddy was putting my clothes into sheets , preparatory to tossing them out the window , when I found her , and I could hardly persuade her to stop . 
I want you to come with me , Liddy , I said . 
Bring a candle and a couple of blankets . 
She lagged behind considerably when she saw me making for the east wing , and at the top of the staircase she balked . 
I am not going down there , she said firmly . 
There is no one guarding the door down there , I explained . 
Who knows ? this may be a scheme to draw everybody away from this end of the house , and let some one in here . 
The instant I had said it I was convinced I had hit on the explanation , and that perhaps it was already too late . 
It seemed to me as I listened that I heard stealthy footsteps on the east porch , but there was so much shouting outside that it was impossible to tell . 
Liddy was on the point of retreat . 
Very well , I said , then I shall go down alone . 
Run back to Mr. Halsey's room and get his revolver . 
Don't shoot down the stairs if you hear a noise remember I shall be down there . 
I put the candle on the floor at the top of the staircase and took off my bedroom slippers . 
Then I crept down the stairs , going very slowly , and listening with all my ears . 
I was keyed to such a pitch that I felt no fear like the condemned who sleep and eat the night before execution , I was no longer able to suffer apprehension . 
And then I knew I was right . 
Some one had put a key into the lock , and was turning it . 
For some reason it refused to work , and the key was withdrawn . 
There was a muttering of voices outside I had only a second . 
Another trial , and the door would open . 
The candle above made a faint gleam down the well like staircase , and at that moment , with a second , no more , to spare , I thought of a plan . 
The heavy oak chair almost filled the space between the newel post and the door . 
With a crash I had turned it on its side , wedging it against the door , its legs against the stairs . 
Thank God , she said , in a shaking voice . 
I thought it was you . 
I pointed to the door , and she understood . 
Call out the windows at the other end of the house , I whispered . 
Tell them not to wait for anything . 
She went up the stairs at that , two at a time . 
Evidently she collided with the candle , for it went out , and I was left in darkness . 
I was really astonishingly cool . 
But the chair held , although I could hear an ominous cracking of one of the legs . 
And then , without the slightest warning , the card room window broke with a crash . 
I had my finger on the trigger of the revolver , and as I jumped it went off , right through the door . 
Some one outside swore roundly , and for the first time I could hear what was said . 
Men are at the other end of the house . 
Have the whole rat's nest on us . 
And a lot of profanity which I won't write down . 
The voices were at the broken window now , and although I was trembling violently , I was determined that I would hold them until help came . 
I moved up the stairs until I could see into the card room , or rather through it , to the window . 
As I looked a small man put his leg over the sill and stepped into the room . 
The curtain confused him for a moment then he turned , not toward me , but toward the billiard room door . 
I fired again , and something that was glass or china crashed to the ground . 
Then I ran up the stairs and along the corridor to the main staircase . 
There was the sound of footsteps in the lower hall , and some one bounded up the stairs . 
I had gone Berserk , I think . 
I leaned over the stair rail and fired again . 
Halsey , below , yelled at me . 
What are you doing up there ? he yelled . 
You missed me by an inch . 
And then I collapsed and fainted . 
When I came around Liddy was rubbing my temples with eau de quinine , and the search was in full blast . 
Well , the man was gone . 
The stable burned to the ground , while the crowd cheered at every falling rafter , and the volunteer fire department sprayed it with a garden hose . 
And in the house Alex and Halsey searched every corner of the lower floor , finding no one . 
The truth of my story was shown by the broken window and the overturned chair . 
That the unknown had got up stairs was almost impossible . 
But we did not go to bed at all . 
Sam Bohannon and Warner helped in the search , and not a closet escaped scrutiny . 
Even the cellars were given a thorough overhauling , without result . 
The door in the east entry had a hole through it where my bullet had gone . 
The hole slanted downward , and the bullet was embedded in the porch . 
Some reddish stains showed it had done execution . 
Somebody will walk lame , Halsey said , when he had marked the course of the bullet . 
It's too low to have hit anything but a leg or foot . 
From that time on I watched every person I met for a limp , and to this day the man who halts in his walk is an object of suspicion to me . 
Our man had gone , and the large and expensive stable at Sunnyside was a heap of smoking rafters and charred boards . 
Warner swore the fire was incendiary , and in view of the attempt to enter the house , there seemed to be no doubt of it . 
CHAPTER XXIV FLINDERS If Halsey had only taken me fully into his confidence , through the whole affair , it would have been much simpler . 
But young people refuse to profit by the experience of their elders , and sometimes the elders are the ones to suffer . 
I was much used up the day after the fire , and Gertrude insisted on my going out . 
The machine was temporarily out of commission , and the carriage horses had been sent to a farm for the summer . 
Gertrude finally got a trap from the Casanova liveryman , and we went out . 
Just as we turned from the drive into the road we passed a woman . 
She had put down a small valise , and stood inspecting the house and grounds minutely . 
I should hardly have noticed her , had it not been for the fact that she had been horribly disfigured by smallpox . 
Ugh ! Gertrude said , when we had passed , what a face ! I shall dream of it to night . 
Is that the horse's name ? It is . 
She flicked the horse's stubby mane with the whip . 
He didn't look like a livery horse , and the liveryman said he had bought him from the Armstrongs when they purchased a couple of motors and cut down the stable . 
At my request Halsey had already sent word of the fire to the agent from whom we had secured the house . 
Also , he had called Mr. Jamieson by telephone , and somewhat guardedly had told him of the previous night's events . 
Mr. Jamieson promised to come out that night , and to bring another man with him . 
I did not consider it necessary to notify Mrs. Armstrong , in the village . 
No doubt she knew of the fire , and in view of my refusal to give up the house , an interview would probably have been unpleasant enough . 
But as we passed Doctor Walker's white and green house I thought of something . 
Stop here , Gertrude , I said . 
I am going to get out . 
To see Louise ? she asked . 
No , I want to ask this young Walker something . 
She was curious , I knew , but I did not wait to explain . 
I went up the walk to the house , where a brass sign at the side announced the office , and went in . 
The reception room was empty , but from the consulting room beyond came the sound of two voices , not very amicable . 
It is an outrageous figure , some one was storming . 
Then the doctor's quiet tone , evidently not arguing , merely stating something . 
But I had not time to listen to some person probably disputing his bill , so I coughed . 
The voices ceased at once a door closed somewhere , and the doctor entered from the hall of the house . 
He looked sufficiently surprised at seeing me . 
Good afternoon , Doctor , I said formally . 
I shall not keep you from your patient . 
I wish merely to ask you a question . 
Won't you sit down ? It will not be necessary . 
A bullet wound ! Things must be lively at Sunnyside . 
I didn't say it was at Sunnyside . 
But as it happens , it was . 
If any such case comes to you , will it be too much trouble for you to let me know ? I shall be only too happy , he said . 
I understand you have had a fire up there , too . 
A fire and shooting in one night is rather lively for a quiet place like that . 
It is as quiet as a boiler shop , I replied , as I turned to go . 
And you are still going to stay ? Until I am burned out , I responded . 
And then on my way down the steps , I turned around suddenly . 
Doctor , I asked at a venture , have you ever heard of a child named Lucien Wallace ? Clever as he was , his face changed and stiffened . 
He was on his guard again in a moment . 
Lucien Wallace ? he repeated . 
No , I think not . 
There are plenty of Wallaces around , but I don't know any Lucien . 
I was as certain as possible that he did . 
People do not lie readily to me , and this man lied beyond a doubt . 
But there was nothing to be gained now his defenses were up , and I left , half irritated and wholly baffled . 
Our reception was entirely different at Doctor Stewart's . 
Of the more serious part of the night's experience , of course , we said nothing . 
But when at last we had left the family on the porch and the good doctor was untying our steed , I asked him the same question I had put to Doctor Walker . 
Bless my soul , no . 
Please don't mention it we wish to make as little of it as possible . 
There was one other possibility , and we tried that . 
At Casanova station I saw the station master , and asked him if any trains left Casanova between one o'clock and daylight . 
There was none until six A. M. The next question required more diplomacy . 
Did you notice on the six o'clock train any person any man who limped a little ? I asked . 
Please try to remember we are trying to trace a man who was seen loitering around Sunnyside last night before the fire . 
He was all attention in a moment . 
I was up there myself at the fire , he said volubly . 
I'm a member of the volunteer company . 
First big fire we've had since the summer house burned over to the club golf links . 
My wife was sayin' the other day , Dave , you might as well 'a' saved the money in that there helmet and shirt . 
And here last night they came in handy . 
Rang that bell so hard I hadn't time scarcely to get 'em on . 
And did you see a man who limped ? Gertrude put in , as he stopped for breath . 
Not at the train , ma'm , he said . 
No such person got on here to day . 
But I'll tell you where I did see a man that limped . 
I didn't wait till the fire company left there's a fast freight goes through at four forty five , and I had to get down to the station . 
I seen there wasn't much more to do anyhow at the fire we'd got the flames under control Gertrude looked at me and smiled so I started down the hill . 
There was folks here and there goin' home , and along by the path to the Country Club I seen two men . 
One was a short fellow . 
He was sitting on a big rock , his back to me , and he had something white in his hand , as if he was tying up his foot . 
After I'd gone on a piece I looked back , and he was hobbling on and excuse me , miss he was swearing something sickening . 
Did they go toward the club ? Gertrude asked suddenly , leaning forward . 
I think they came into the village . 
I didn't get a look at their faces , but I know every chick and child in the place , and everybody knows me . 
When they didn't shout at me in my uniform , you know I took it they were strangers . 
Also , Doctor Walker knew who Lucien Wallace was , and his very denial made me confident that , in that one direction at least , we were on the right track . 
The thought that the detective would be there that night was the most cheering thing of all , and I think even Gertrude was glad of it . 
Driving home that afternoon , I saw her in the clear sunlight for the first time in several days , and I was startled to see how ill she looked . 
She was thin and colorless , and all her bright animation was gone . 
Gertrude , I said , I have been a very selfish old woman . 
You are going to leave this miserable house to night . 
Annie Morton is going to Scotland next week , and you shall go right with her . 
To my surprise , she flushed painfully . 
I don't want to go , Aunt Ray , she said . 
Don't make me leave now . 
You are losing your health and your good looks , I said decidedly . 
You should have a change . 
I shan't stir a foot . 
Then , more lightly Why , you and Liddy need me to arbitrate between you every day in the week . 
Perhaps I was growing suspicious of every one , but it seemed to me that Gertrude's gaiety was forced and artificial . 
I watched her covertly during the rest of the drive , and I did not like the two spots of crimson in her pale cheeks . 
But I said nothing more about sending her to Scotland I knew she would not go . 
Eliza was in a frenzy of fear . 
She clutched at my sleeve when I went close to her , and refused to let go until she had told her story . 
I didn't want to do it , Miss Innes , Alex said . 
But she was so excited , I was afraid she would do as she said drag it down herself , and scratch the staircase . 
I was trying to get my bonnet off and to keep the maids quiet at the same time . 
Now , Eliza , when you have washed your face and stopped bawling , I said , come into my sitting room and tell me what has happened . 
Liddy put away my things without speaking . 
The very set of her shoulders expressed disapproval . 
Well , I said , when the silence became uncomfortable , things seem to be warming up . 
Silence from Liddy , and a long sigh . 
If Eliza goes , I don't know where to look for another cook . 
Rosie is probably a good cook . 
Liddy , I said at last , don't dare to deny that you are having the time of your life . 
You positively gloat in this excitement . 
It's my opinion all this running around , and getting jolted out of a rut , has stirred up that torpid liver of yours . 
It's not myself I'm thinking about , she said , goaded into speech . 
Well , I'm glad of that anything for a change , I said . 
And in came Eliza , flanked by Rosie and Mary Anne . 
she had gone up stairs to get a picture from her room to show Mary Anne . 
She went up the servants' staircase and along the corridor to her room , which lay between the trunk room and the unfinished ball room . 
She heard a sound as she went down the corridor , like some one moving furniture , but she was not nervous . 
She thought it might be men examining the house after the fire the night before , but she looked in the trunk room and saw nobody . 
She went into her room quietly . 
The noise had ceased , and everything was quiet . 
she put her head down on her pillow and Took a nap . 
All right ! I said . 
When I came to , Miss Innes , sure as I'm sittin' here , I thought I'd die . 
Somethin' hit me on the face , and I set up , sudden . 
And then I seen the plaster drop , droppin' from a little hole in the wall . 
shot through that hole and tumbled on the bed . 
I'd 'a' been hit on the head and killed ! I wisht you'd heard her scream , put in Mary Anne . 
And her face as white as a pillow slip when she tumbled down the stairs . 
No doubt there is some natural explanation for it , Eliza , I said . 
You may have dreamed it , in your fainting' attack . 
But if it is true , the metal rod and the hole in the wall will show it . 
Eliza looked a little bit sheepish . 
The hole's there all right , Miss Innes , she said . 
But the bar was gone when Mary Anne and Rosie went up to pack my trunk . 
That wasn't all , Liddy's voice came funereally from a corner . 
Eliza said that from the hole in the wall a burning eye looked down at her ! The wall must be at least six inches thick , I said with asperity . 
Unless the person who drilled the hole carried his eyes on the ends of a stick , Eliza couldn't possibly have seen them . 
But the fact remained , and a visit to Eliza's room proved it . 
Not the least mysterious thing was the disappearance of the iron implement that had been used . 
I remembered a story I read once about an impish dwarf that lived in the spaces between the double walls of an ancient castle . 
Mary Anne and Eliza left that afternoon , but Rosie decided to stay . 
It was about five o'clock when the hack came from the station to get them , and , to my amazement , it had an occupant . 
Matthew Geist , the driver , asked for me , and explained his errand with pride . 
I've brought you a cook , Miss Innes , he said . 
Already I had acquired the true suburbanite ability to take servants on faith I no longer demanded written and unimpeachable references . 
And so that day I merely told Liddy to send the new applicant in . 
When she came , however , I could hardly restrain a gasp of surprise . 
It was the woman with the pitted face . 
She stood somewhat awkwardly just inside the door , and she had an air of self confidence that was inspiring . 
Yes , she could cook was not a fancy cook , but could make good soups and desserts if there was any one to take charge of the salads . 
And so , in the end , I took her . 
As Halsey said , when we told him , it didn't matter much about the cook's face , if it was clean . 
I have spoken of Halsey's restlessness . 
On that day it seemed to be more than ever a resistless impulse that kept him out until after luncheon . 
Part of the afternoon I believe he read Gertrude and I were out , as I have said , and at dinner we both noticed that something had occurred to distract him . 
He was disagreeable , which is unlike him , nervous , looking at his watch every few minutes , and he ate almost nothing . 
He refused dessert , and left the table early , excusing himself on the ground that he wanted to see Alex . 
Alex , however , was not to be found . 
It was after eight when Halsey ordered the car , and started down the hill at a pace that , even for him , was unusually reckless . 
Shortly after , Alex reported that he was ready to go over the house , preparatory to closing it for the night . 
At half past nine I heard the sound of a horse driven furiously up the drive . 
It came to a stop in front of the house , and immediately after there were hurried steps on the veranda . 
Our nerves were not what they should have been , and Gertrude , always apprehensive lately , was at the door almost instantly . 
A moment later Louise had burst into the room and stood there bareheaded and breathing hard ! Where is Halsey ? she demanded . 
Above her plain black gown her eyes looked big and somber , and the rapid drive had brought no color to her face . 
I got up and drew forward a chair . 
He has not come back , I said quietly . 
Sit down , child you are not strong enough for this kind of thing . 
I don't think she even heard me . 
He has not come back ? she asked , looking from me to Gertrude . 
Do you know where he went ? Where can I find him ? For Heaven's sake , Louise , Gertrude burst out , tell us what is wrong . 
He has gone to the station for Mr. Jamieson . 
What has happened ? To the station , Gertrude ? You are sure ? Yes , I said . 
There is the whistle of the train now . 
She relaxed a little at our matter of fact tone , and allowed herself to sink into a chair . 
Perhaps I was wrong , she said heavily . 
He will be here in a few moments if everything is right . 
We sat there , the three of us , without attempt at conversation . 
Both Gertrude and I recognized the futility of asking Louise any questions her reticence was a part of a role she had assumed . 
Our ears were strained for the first throb of the motor as it turned into the drive and commenced the climb to the house . 
Ten minutes passed , fifteen , twenty . 
I saw Louise's hands grow rigid as they clutched the arms of her chair . 
I watched Gertrude's bright color slowly ebbing away , and around my own heart I seemed to feel the grasp of a giant hand . 
Twenty five minutes , and then a sound . 
But it was not the chug of the motor it was the unmistakable rumble of the Casanova hack . 
Gertrude drew aside the curtain and peered into the darkness . 
It's the hack , I am sure , she said , evidently relieved . 
Something has gone wrong with the car , and no wonder the way Halsey went down the hill . 
It seemed a long time before the creaking vehicle came to a stop at the door . 
Louise rose and stood watching , her hand to her throat . 
And then Gertrude opened the door , admitting Mr. Jamieson and a stocky , middle aged man . 
Halsey was not with them . 
When the door had closed and Louise realized that Halsey had not come , her expression changed . 
From tense watchfulness to relief , and now again to absolute despair , her face was an open page . 
Halsey ? I asked unceremoniously , ignoring the stranger . 
Did he not meet you ? No. Mr. Jamieson looked slightly surprised . 
I rather expected the car , but we got up all right . 
You didn't see him at all ? Louise demanded breathlessly . 
Mr. Jamieson knew her at once , although he had not seen her before . 
She had kept to her rooms until the morning she left . 
No , Miss Armstrong , he said . 
I saw nothing of him . 
What is wrong ? Then we shall have to find him , she asserted . 
Mr. Jamieson , I have reason for believing that he is in danger , but I don't know what it is . 
Only he must be found . 
The stocky man had said nothing . 
Now , however , he went quickly toward the door . 
I'll catch the hack down the road and hold it , he said . 
Is the gentleman down in the town ? Mr. Jamieson , Louise said impulsively , I can use the hack . 
Take my horse and trap outside and drive like mad . 
Try to find the Dragon Fly it ought to be easy to trace . 
I can think of no other way . 
Only , don't lose a moment . 
The new detective had gone , and a moment later Jamieson went rapidly down the drive , the cob's feet striking fire at every step . 
Louise stood looking after them . 
When she turned around she faced Gertrude , who stood indignant , almost tragic , in the hall . 
You KNOW what threatens Halsey , Louise , she said accusingly . 
I believe you know this whole horrible thing , this mystery that we are struggling with . 
If anything happens to Halsey , I shall never forgive you . 
Louise only raised her hands despairingly and dropped them again . 
He is as dear to me as he is to you , she said sadly . 
I tried to warn him . 
Nonsense ! I said , as briskly as I could . 
We are making a lot of trouble out of something perhaps very small . 
Halsey was probably late he is always late . 
Any moment we may hear the car coming up the road . 
But it did not come . 
After a half hour of suspense , Louise went out quietly , and did not come back . 
I hardly knew she was gone until I heard the station hack moving off . 
At eleven o'clock the telephone rang . 
I have found the Dragon Fly , Miss Innes , he said . 
It has collided with a freight car on the siding above the station . 
No , Mr. Innes was not there , but we shall probably find him . 
Send Warner for the car . 
But they did not find him . 
At four o'clock the next morning we were still waiting for news , while Alex watched the house and Sam the grounds . 
At daylight I dropped into exhausted sleep . 
Halsey had not come back , and there was no word from the detective . 
CHAPTER XXVI HALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE Nothing that had gone before had been as bad as this . 
The murder and Thomas' sudden death we had been able to view in a detached sort of way . 
But with Halsey's disappearance everything was altered . 
Our little circle , intact until now , was broken . 
We were no longer onlookers who saw a battle passing around them . 
We were the center of action . 
Of course , there was no time then to voice such an idea . 
My mind seemed able to hold only one thought that Halsey had been foully dealt with , and that every minute lost might be fatal . 
Mr. Jamieson came back about eight o'clock the next morning he was covered with mud , and his hat was gone . 
Altogether , we were a sad looking trio that gathered around a breakfast that no one could eat . 
Over a cup of black coffee the detective told us what he had learned of Halsey's movements the night before . 
Up to a certain point the car had made it easy enough to follow him . 
And I gathered that Mr. Burns , the other detective , had followed a similar car for miles at dawn , only to find it was a touring car on an endurance run . 
He left here about ten minutes after eight , Mr Jamieson said . 
He went alone , and at eight twenty he stopped at Doctor Walker's . 
I went to the doctor's about midnight , but he had been called out on a case , and had not come back at four o'clock . 
From the doctor's it seems Mr. Innes walked across the lawn to the cottage Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter have taken . 
Mrs. Armstrong had retired , and he said perhaps a dozen words to Miss Louise . 
She will not say what they were , but the girl evidently suspects what has occurred . 
That is , she suspects foul play , but she doesn't know of what nature . 
Then , apparently , he started directly for the station . 
He was going very fast the flagman at the Carol Street crossing says he saw the car pass . 
Along somewhere in the dark stretch between Carol Street and the depot he evidently swerved suddenly perhaps some one in the road and went full into the side of a freight . 
We found it there last night . 
He might have been thrown under the train by the force of the shock , I said tremulously . 
We examined every inch of track . 
But surely he can't be gone ! I cried . 
Aren't there traces in the mud anything ? There is no mud only dust . 
There has been no rain . 
And the footpath there is of cinders . 
Miss Innes , I am inclined to think that he has met with bad treatment , in the light of what has gone before . 
I do not think he has been murdered . 
I shrank from the word . 
Burns is back in the country , on a clue we got from the night clerk at the drug store . 
There will be two more men here by noon , and the city office is on the lookout . 
The creek ? Gertrude asked . 
The creek is shallow now . 
If it were swollen with rain , it would be different . 
There is hardly any water in it . 
Now , Miss Innes , he said , turning to me , I must ask you some questions . 
Had Mr. Halsey any possible reason for going away like this , without warning ? None whatever . 
He went away once before , he persisted . 
And you were as sure then . 
He did not leave the Dragon Fly jammed into the side of a freight car before . 
No , but he left it for repairs in a blacksmith shop , a long distance from here . 
Was he in the habit of carrying money ? He never carried it far . 
No , he never had more than enough for current expenses . 
Mr. Jamieson got up then and began to pace the room . 
It was an unwonted concession to the occasion . 
Then I think we get at it by elimination . 
The chances are against flight . 
If he was hurt , we find no trace of him . 
It looks almost like an abduction . 
This young Doctor Walker have you any idea why Mr. Innes should have gone there last night ? I can not understand it , Gertrude said thoughtfully . 
I don't think he knew Doctor Walker at all , and their relations could hardly have been cordial , under the circumstances . 
Jamieson pricked up his ears , and little by little he drew from us the unfortunate story of Halsey's love affair , and the fact that Louise was going to marry Doctor Walker . 
There are some interesting developments here , he said thoughtfully . 
The woman who claims to be the mother of Lucien Wallace has not come back . 
Your nephew has apparently been spirited away . 
There is an organized attempt being made to enter this house in fact , it has been entered . 
Witness the incident with the cook yesterday . 
And I have a new piece of information . 
He looked carefully away from Gertrude . 
Mr. John Bailey is not at his Knickerbocker apartments , and I don't know where he is . 
It's a hash , that's what it is . 
They won't fit together , unless unless Mr. Bailey and your nephew have again And once again Gertrude surprised me . 
They are not together , she said hotly . 
I know where Mr. Bailey is , and my brother is not with him . 
The detective turned and looked at her keenly . 
I believe I could find your brother , and I might be able to well , to do some other things . 
But Gertrude's glance did not falter . 
Nothing that I know could help you to find Halsey , she said stubbornly . 
I know absolutely as little of his disappearance as you do , and I can only say this I do not trust Doctor Walker . 
I think he hated Halsey , and he would get rid of him if he could . 
In fact , I had some such theory myself . 
But Doctor Walker went out late last night to a serious case in Summitville , and is still there . 
We have made guarded inquiry at the Greenwood Club , and through the village . 
There is absolutely nothing to go on but this . 
On the embankment above the railroad , at the point where we found the machine , is a small house . 
An old woman and a daughter , who is very lame , live there . 
They say that they distinctly heard the shock when the Dragon Fly hit the car , and they went to the bottom of their garden and looked over . 
The automobile was there they could see the lights , and they thought someone had been injured . 
It was very dark , but they could make out two figures , standing together . 
The women were curious , and , leaving the fence , they went back and by a roundabout path down to the road . 
When they got there the car was still standing , the headlight broken and the bonnet crushed , but there was no one to be seen . 
The detective went away immediately , and to Gertrude and me was left the woman's part , to watch and wait . 
By luncheon nothing had been found , and I was frantic . 
I went up stairs to Halsey's room finally , from sheer inability to sit across from Gertrude any longer , and meet her terror filled eyes . 
Liddy was in my dressing room , suspiciously red eyed , and trying to put a right sleeve in a left armhole of a new waist for me . 
I was too much shaken to scold . 
What name did that woman in the kitchen give ? she demanded , viciously ripping out the offending sleeve . 
Mattie Bliss , I replied . 
M. B. Well , that's not what she has on he suitcase . 
It is marked N. F. C. The new cook and her initials troubled me not at all . 
I put on my bonnet and sent for what the Casanova liveryman called a stylish turnout . 
Having once made up my mind to a course of action , I am not one to turn back . 
Warner had something on his mind , and after we had turned into the road , he voiced it . 
Miss Innes , he said . 
I overheard a part of a conversation yesterday that I didn't understand . 
It wasn't my business to understand it , for that matter . 
But I've been thinking all day that I'd better tell you . 
I went into the living room , where Miss Liddy said he was , and half way across to the library I heard him talking to some one . 
He seemed to be walking up and down , and he was in a rage , I can tell you . 
Then somebody else spoke up it was a woman . 
She said , I warned them , but they thought I would be afraid . 
A woman ! Did you wait to see who it was ? I wasn't spying , Miss Innes , Warner said with dignity . 
But the next thing caught my attention . 
She said , I knew there was something wrong from the start . 
A man isn't well one day , and dead the next , without some reason . 
I thought she was speaking of Thomas . 
And you don't know who it was ! I exclaimed . 
Warner , you had the key to this whole occurrence in your hands , and did not use it ! However , there was nothing to be done . 
I resolved to make inquiry when I got home , and in the meantime , my present errand absorbed me . 
This was nothing less than to see Louise Armstrong , and to attempt to drag from her what she knew , or suspected , of Halsey's disappearance . 
But here , as in every , direction I turned , I was baffled . 
A neat maid answered the bell , but she stood squarely in the doorway , and it was impossible to preserve one's dignity and pass her . 
Miss Armstrong is very ill , and unable to see any one , she said . 
I did not believe her . 
And Mrs. Armstrong is she also ill ? She is with Miss Louise and can not be disturbed . 
Tell her it is Miss Innes , and that it is a matter of the greatest importance . 
It would be of no use , Miss Innes . 
At that moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs . 
Past the maid's white strapped shoulder I could see a familiar thatch of gray hair , and in a moment I was face to face with Doctor Stewart . 
He was very grave , and his customary geniality was tinged with restraint . 
You are the very woman I want to see , he said promptly . 
Send away your trap , and let me drive you home . 
What is this about your nephew ? He has disappeared , doctor . 
Not only that , but there is every evidence that he has been either abducted , or I could not finish . 
The doctor helped me into his capacious buggy in silence . 
Until we had got a little distance he did not speak then he turned and looked at me . 
Now tell me about it , he said . 
He heard me through without speaking . 
And you think Louise knows something ? he said when I had finished . 
I don't in fact , I am sure of it . 
The best evidence of it is this she asked me if he had been heard from , or if anything had been learned . 
She won't allow Walker in the room , and she made me promise to see you and tell you this don't give up the search for him . 
Find him , and find him soon . 
Well , I said , if she knows that , she knows more . 
She is a very cruel and ungrateful girl . 
She is a very sick girl , he said gravely . 
Neither you nor I can judge her until we know everything . 
Both she and her mother are ghosts of their former selves . 
And when it does , we shall find Louise Armstrong a victim . 
The siding , however , was empty . 
Except a few bits of splintered wood on the ground , there was no sign of the accident . 
Where is the freight car that was rammed ? the doctor asked a bystander . 
It was taken away at daylight , when the train was moved . 
There was nothing to be gained . 
He pointed out the house on the embankment where the old lady and her daughter had heard the crash and seen two figures beside the car . 
Then we drove slowly home . 
Not far from the west wing lay the blackened ruins of the stables . 
I felt like a ruin myself , as I paused on the broad veranda before I entered the house . 
Two private detectives had arrived in my absence , and it was a relief to turn over to them the responsibility of the house and grounds . 
Mr. Jamieson , they said , had arranged for more to assist in the search for the missing man , and at that time the country was being scoured in all directions . 
The household staff was again depleted that afternoon . 
Liddy was waiting to tell me that the new cook had gone , bag and baggage , without waiting to be paid . 
No one had admitted the visitor whom Warner had heard in the library , unless , possibly , the missing cook . 
Again I was working in a circle . 
CHAPTER XXVII WHO IS NINA CARRINGTON ? The four days , from Saturday to the following Tuesday , we lived , or existed , in a state of the most dreadful suspense . 
We ate only when Liddy brought in a tray , and then very little . 
The papers , of course , had got hold of the story , and we were besieged by newspaper men . 
From all over the country false clues came pouring in and raised hopes that crumbled again to nothing . 
Every morgue within a hundred miles , every hospital , had been visited , without result . 
Mr. Jamieson , personally , took charge of the organized search , and every evening , no matter where he happened to be , he called us by long distance telephone . 
It was the same formula . 
A new clue to work on . 
And heartsick we would put up the receiver and sit down again to our vigil . 
Liddy cried all day , and , because she knew I objected to tears , sniffled audibly around the corner . 
For Heaven's sake , smile ! I snapped at her . 
And her ghastly attempt at a grin , with her swollen nose and red eyes , made me hysterical . 
I laughed and cried together , and pretty soon , like the two old fools we were , we were sitting together weeping into the same handkerchief . 
Things were happening , of course , all the time , but they made little or no impression . 
The Charity Hospital called up Doctor Stewart and reported that Mrs. Watson was in a critical condition . 
I understood also that legal steps were being taken to terminate my lease at Sunnyside . 
Louise was out of danger , but very ill , and a trained nurse guarded her like a gorgon . 
On Tuesday , then , I sent for the car , and prepared to go out . 
As I waited at the porte cochere I saw the under gardener , an inoffensive , grayish haired man , trimming borders near the house . 
The day detective was watching him , sitting on the carriage block . 
When he saw me , he got up . 
Miss Innes , he said , taking of his hat , do you know where Alex , the gardener , is ? Why , no . 
Isn't he here ? I asked . 
He has been gone since yesterday afternoon . 
Have you employed him long ? Only a couple of weeks . 
Is he efficient ? A capable man ? I hardly know , I said vaguely . 
The place looks all right , and I know very little about such things . 
I know much more about boxes of roses than bushes of them . 
This man , pointing to the assistant , says Alex isn't a gardener . 
That he doesn't know anything about plants . 
That's very strange , I said , thinking hard . 
Why , he came to me from the Brays , who are in Europe . 
Warner came up with the car then , and the conversation stopped . 
As he helped me in , however , the detective said something further . 
Not a word or sign to Alex , if he comes back , he said cautiously . 
I went first to Doctor Walker's . 
I was tired of beating about the bush , and I felt that the key to Halsey's disappearance was here at Casanova , in spite of Mr. Jamieson's theories . 
He came at once to the door of his consulting room , and there was no mask of cordiality in his manner . 
Please come in , he said curtly . 
I shall stay here , I think , doctor . 
I did not like his face or his manner there was a subtle change in both . 
He had thrown of the air of friendliness , and I thought , too , that he looked anxious and haggard . 
Doctor Walker , I said , I have come to you to ask some questions . 
I hope you will answer them . 
As you know , my nephew has not yet been found . 
So I understand , stiffly . 
I believe , if you would , you could help us , and that leads to one of my questions . 
Really , Miss Innes , don't you think you exaggerate ? I understand it is not the first time Mr. Innes has disappeared . 
You are quibbling , doctor . 
This is a matter of life and death . 
Will you answer my question ? Certainly . 
He said his nerves were bad , and I gave him a prescription for them . 
I am violating professional ethics when I tell you even as much as that . 
I could not tell him he lied . 
I think I looked it . 
But I hazarded a random shot . 
I thought perhaps , I said , watching him narrowly , that it might be about Nina Carrington . 
For a moment I thought he was going to strike me . 
He grew livid , and a small crooked blood vessel in his temple swelled and throbbed curiously . 
Then he forced a short laugh . 
Who is Nina Carrington ? he asked . 
I am about to discover that , I replied , and he was quiet at once . 
It was not difficult to divine that he feared Nina Carrington a good deal more than he did the devil . 
Our leave taking was brief in fact , we merely stared at each other over the waiting room table , with its litter of year old magazines . 
Then I turned and went out . 
To Richfield , I told Warner , and on the way I thought , and thought hard . 
Nina Carrington , Nina Carrington , the roar and rush of the wheels seemed to sing the words . 
Nina Carrington , N. C. And I then knew , knew as surely as if I had seen the whole thing . 
There had been an N. C. on the suit case belonging to the woman with the pitted face . 
How simple it all seemed . 
Mattie Bliss had been Nina Carrington . 
It was she Warner had heard in the library . 
It was something she had told Halsey that had taken him frantically to Doctor Walker's office , and from there perhaps to his death . 
If we could find the woman , we might find what had become of Halsey . 
We were almost at Richfield now , so I kept on . 
My mind was not on my errand there now . 
It was back with Halsey on that memorable night . 
Almost exactly the same scene as before greeted my eyes at the cottage . 
Mrs. Tate , the baby carriage in the path , the children at the swing all were the same . 
She came forward to meet me , and I noticed that some of the anxious lines had gone out of her face . 
She looked young , almost pretty . 
I am glad you have come back , she said . 
I think I will have to be honest and give you back your money . 
Has the mother come ? No , but some one came and paid the boy's board for a month . 
She talked to him for a long time , but when I asked him afterward he didn't know her name . 
A young woman ? Not very young . 
About forty , I suppose . 
She was small and fair haired , just a little bit gray , and very sad . 
She was in deep mourning , and , I think , when she came , she expected to go at once . 
But the child , Lucien , interested her . 
She talked to him for a long time , and , indeed , she looked much happier when she left . 
You are sure this was not the real mother ? O mercy , no ! Why , she didn't know which of the three was Lucien . 
I thought perhaps she was a friend of yours , but , of course , I didn't ask . 
She was not pock marked ? I asked at a venture . 
A skin like a baby's . 
But perhaps you will know the initials . 
She gave Lucien a handkerchief and forgot it . 
F. B. A. was Fanny Armstrong , without a chance of doubt ! With another warning to Mrs. Tate as to silence , we started back to Sunnyside . 
So Fanny Armstrong knew of Lucien Wallace , and was sufficiently interested to visit him and pay for his support . 
I wondered if Thomas could have helped us to find Halsey , had he lived . 
Farther along was the more imposing burial ground , where Arnold Armstrong and his father lay in the shadow of a tall granite shaft . 
Of the three , I think Thomas was the only one sincerely mourned . 
CHAPTER XXVIII A TRAMP AND THE TOOTHACHE The bitterness toward the dead president of the Traders' Bank seemed to grow with time . 
Never popular , his memory was execrated by people who had lost nothing , but who were filled with disgust by constantly hearing new stories of the man's grasping avarice . 
The Traders' had been a favorite bank for small tradespeople , and in its savings department it had solicited the smallest deposits . 
People who had thought to be self supporting to the last found themselves confronting the poorhouse , their two or three hundred dollar savings wiped away . 
All bank failures have this element , however , and the directors were trying to promise twenty per cent . 
But , like everything else those days , the bank failure was almost forgotten by Gertrude and myself . 
We did not mention Jack Bailey I had found nothing to change my impression of his guilt , and Gertrude knew how I felt . 
As for the murder of the bank president's son , I was of two minds . 
One day I thought Gertrude knew or at least suspected that Jack had done it the next I feared that it had been Gertrude herself , that night alone on the circular staircase . 
And then the mother of Lucien Wallace would obtrude herself , and an almost equally good case might be made against her . 
There were times , of course , when I was disposed to throw all those suspicions aside , and fix definitely on the unknown , whoever that might be . 
I had my greatest disappointment when it came to tracing Nina Carrington . 
The woman had gone without leaving a trace . 
Marked as she was , it should have been easy to follow her , but she was not to be found . 
A description to one of the detectives , on my arrival at home , had started the ball rolling . 
But by night she had not been found . 
She thought , as I did , that there was little doubt of it . 
I said nothing to her , however , of the detective's suspicions about Alex . 
Little things that I had not noticed at the time now came back to me . 
I had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps Alex was a spy , and that by taking him into the house I had played into the enemy's hand . 
But at eight o'clock that night Alex himself appeared , and with him a strange and repulsive individual . 
They made a queer pair , for Alex was almost as disreputable as the tramp , and he had a badly swollen eye . 
Winters , the detective who watched the house at night , followed them , and kept his eyes sharply on Alex's prisoner . 
For that was the situation as it developed . 
He was a tall lanky individual , ragged and dirty , and just now he looked both terrified and embarrassed . 
Alex was too much engrossed to be either , and to this day I don't think I ever asked him why he went off without permission the day before . 
Miss Innes , Alex began abruptly , this man can tell us something very important about the disappearance of Mr. Innes . 
I found him trying to sell this watch . 
He took a watch from his pocket and put it on the table . 
I had given it to him on his twenty first birthday I was dumb with apprehension . 
He says he had a pair of cuff links also , but he sold them Fer a dollar'n half , put in the disreputable individual hoarsely , with an eye on the detective . 
He is not dead ? I implored . 
The tramp cleared his throat . 
No'm , he said huskily . 
He was used up pretty bad , but he weren't dead . 
He was comin' to hisself when I he stopped and looked at the detective . 
I didn't steal it , Mr. Winters , he whined . 
I found it in the road , honest to God , I did . 
Mr. Winters paid no attention to him . 
I'd better tell what he told me , Alex broke in . 
When Jamieson when Mr Jamieson calls up we can start him right . 
Mr. Winters , I found this man trying to sell that watch on Fifth Street . 
He offered it to me for three dollars . 
How did you know the watch ? Winters snapped at him . 
I had seen it before , many times . 
I used it at night when I was watching at the foot of the staircase . 
When he offered the watch to me , I knew it , and I pretended I was going to buy it . 
We went into an alley and I got the watch . 
It was plain how Alex had secured the watch . 
Then I got the story from this fellow . 
He claims to have seen the whole affair . 
He says he was in an empty car in the car the automobile struck . 
The tramp broke in here , and told his story , with frequent interpretations by Alex and Mr. Winters . 
He used a strange medley , in which familiar words took unfamiliar meanings , but it was gradually made clear to us . 
On the night in question the tramp had been pounding his ear this stuck to me as being graphic in an empty box car along the siding at Casanova . 
The train was going west , and due to leave at dawn . 
The tramp and the brakey were friendly , and things going well . 
About ten o'clock , perhaps earlier , a terrific crash against the side of the car roused him . 
He tried to open the door , but could not move it . 
He got out of the other side , and just as he did so , he heard some one groan . 
The habits of a lifetime made him cautious . 
He slipped on to the bumper of a car and peered through . 
An automobile had struck the car , and stood there on two wheels . 
The tail lights were burning , but the headlights were out . 
Two men were stooping over some one who lay on the ground . 
Then the taller of the two started on a dog trot along the train looking for an empty . 
He found one four cars away and ran back again . 
The two lifted the unconscious man into the empty box car , and , getting in themselves , stayed for three or four minutes . 
When they came out , after closing the sliding door , they cut up over the railroad embankment toward the town . 
One , the short one , seemed to limp . 
He waited for ten minutes or so . 
Some women came down a path to the road and inspected the automobile . 
When they had gone , he crawled into the box car and closed the door again . 
Then he lighted a match . 
The figure of a man , unconscious , gagged , and with his hands tied , lay far at the end . 
The tramp lost no time he went through his pockets , found a little money and the cuff links , and took them . 
Then he loosened the gag it had been cruelly tight and went his way , again closing the door of the box car . 
Outside on the road he found the watch . 
He got on the fast freight east , some time after , and rode into the city . 
He had sold the cuff links , but on offering the watch to Alex he had been copped . 
The story , with its cold recital of villainy , was done . 
I hardly knew if I were more anxious , or less . 
That it was Halsey , there could be no doubt . 
How badly he was hurt , how far he had been carried , were the questions that demanded immediate answer . 
But it was the first real information we had had my boy had not been murdered outright . 
But instead of vague terrors there was now the real fear that he might be lying in some strange hospital receiving the casual attention commonly given to the charity cases . 
Even this , had we known it , would have been paradise to the terrible truth . 
I wake yet and feel myself cold and trembling with the horror of Halsey's situation for three days after his disappearance . 
Mr. Winters and Alex disposed of the tramp with a warning . 
It was evident he had told us all he knew . 
We had occasion , within a day or two , to be doubly thankful that we had given him his freedom . 
The cars by this time , three days , might be scattered over the Union . 
But he said to keep on hoping , that it was the best news we had had . 
And in the meantime , consumed with anxiety as we were , things were happening at the house in rapid succession . 
We had one peaceful day then Liddy took sick in the night . 
I went in when I heard her groaning , and found her with a hot water bottle to her face , and her right cheek swollen until it was glassy . 
Toothache ? I asked , not too gently . 
A woman of your age , who would rather go around with an exposed nerve in her head than have the tooth pulled ! It would be over in a moment . 
So would hanging , Liddy protested , from behind the hot water bottle . 
I was hunting around for cotton and laudanum . 
You have a tooth just like it yourself , Miss Rachel , she whimpered . 
And I'm sure Doctor Boyle's been trying to take it out for years . 
There was no laudanum , and Liddy made a terrible fuss when I proposed carbolic acid , just because I had put too much on the cotton once and burned her mouth . 
I'm sure it never did her any permanent harm indeed , the doctor said afterward that living on liquid diet had been a splendid rest for her stomach . 
But she would have none of the acid , and she kept me awake groaning , so at last I got up and went to Gertrude's door . 
To my surprise , it was locked . 
I went around by the hall and into her bedroom that way . 
The bed was turned down , and her dressing gown and night dress lay ready in the little room next , but Gertrude was not there . 
I don't know what terrible thoughts came to me in the minute I stood there . 
Through the door I could hear Liddy grumbling , with a squeal now and then when the pain stabbed harder . 
Then , automatically , I got the laudanum and went back to her . 
It was fully a half hour before Liddy's groans subsided . 
At intervals I went to the door into the hall and looked out , but I saw and heard nothing suspicious . 
And then , far off , I heard the rapping noise that had lured Louise down the staircase that other night , two weeks before . 
It was over my head , and very faint three or four short muffled taps , a pause , and then again , stealthily repeated . 
The sound of Mr. Winters' breathing was comforting with the thought that there was help within call , something kept me from waking him . 
Almost beside me was the clothes chute . 
I could feel it , but I could see nothing . 
As I stood , listening intently , I heard a sound near me . 
It was vague , indefinite . 
Then it ceased there was an uneasy movement and a grunt from the foot of the circular staircase , and silence again . 
I stood perfectly still , hardly daring to breathe . 
Then I knew I had been right . 
Some one was stealthily passing the head of the staircase and coming toward me in the dark . 
I leaned against the wall for support my knees were giving way . 
The steps were close now , and suddenly I thought of Gertrude . 
Of course it was Gertrude . 
I put out one hand in front of me , but I touched nothing . 
My voice almost refused me , but I managed to gasp out , Gertrude ! Good Lord ! a man's voice exclaimed , just beside me . 
I felt myself going , felt some one catch me , a horrible nausea that was all I remembered . 
When I came to it was dawn . 
I was lying on the bed in Louise's room , with the cherub on the ceiling staring down at me , and there was a blanket from my own bed thrown over me . 
I felt weak and dizzy , but I managed to get up and totter to the door . 
At the foot of the circular staircase Mr. Winters was still asleep . 
Hardly able to stand , I crept back to my room . 
The door into Gertrude's room was no longer locked she was sleeping like a tired child . 
And in my dressing room Liddy hugged a cold hot water bottle , and mumbled in her sleep . 
There's some things you can't hold with hand cuffs , she was muttering thickly . 
CHAPTER XXIX A SCRAP OF PAPER For the first time in twenty years , I kept my bed that day . 
Liddy was alarmed to the point of hysteria , and sent for Doctor Stewart just after breakfast . 
Gertrude spent the morning with me , reading something I forget what . 
I was too busy with my thoughts to listen . 
I had said nothing to the two detectives . 
The whole situation was terrible had the issues been less vital , it would have been absurd . 
All that morning , while Gertrude read aloud , and Liddy watched for the doctor , I was puzzling over that voice , without result . 
And there were other things , too . 
I wondered what Gertrude's absence from her room had to do with it all , or if it had any connection . 
I tried to think that she had heard the rapping noises before I did and gone to investigate , but I'm afraid I was a moral coward that day . 
I could not ask her . 
Perhaps the diversion was good for me . 
It took my mind from Halsey , and the story we had heard the night before . 
The day , however , was a long vigil , with every ring of the telephone full of possibilities . 
Doctor Walker came up , some time just after luncheon , and asked for me . 
Go down and see him , I instructed Gertrude . 
Tell him I am out for mercy's sake don't say I'm sick . 
Find out what he wants , and from this time on , instruct the servants that he is not to be admitted . 
Gertrude came back very soon , her face rather flushed . 
He came to ask us to get out , she said , picking up her book with a jerk . 
He looked daggers at me . 
And he wanted to know if we would recommend Eliza as a cook . 
He has brought a patient , a man , out from town , and is increasing his establishment that's the way he put it . 
I wish him joy of Eliza , I said tartly . 
Did he ask for Halsey ? Yes . 
I told him that we were on the track last night , and that it was only a question of time . 
He said he was glad , although he didn't appear to be , but he said not to be too sanguine . 
Do you know what I believe ? I asked . 
I believe , as firmly as I believe anything , that Doctor Walker knows something about Halsey , and that he could put his finger on him , if he wanted to . 
There were several things that day that bewildered me . 
About three o'clock Mr. Jamieson telephoned from the Casanova station and Warner went down to meet him . 
I got up and dressed hastily , and the detective was shown up to my sitting room . 
No news ? I asked , as he entered . 
He tried to look encouraging , without success . 
I noticed that he looked tired and dusty , and , although he was ordinarily impeccable in his appearance , it was clear that he was at least two days from a razor . 
It won't be long now , Miss Innes , he said . 
I have come out here on a peculiar errand , which I will tell you about later . 
First , I want to ask some questions . 
Did any one come out here yesterday to repair the telephone , and examine the wires on the roof ? Yes , I said promptly but it was not the telephone . 
He said the wiring might have caused the fire at the stable . 
I went up with him myself , but he only looked around . 
Good for you ! he applauded . 
Don't allow any one in the house that you don't trust , and don't trust anybody . 
All are not electricians who wear rubber gloves . 
He refused to explain further , but he got a slip of paper out of his pocketbook and opened it carefully . 
You heard this before and scoffed . 
In the light of recent developments I want you to read it again . 
You are a clever woman , Miss Innes . 
Just as surely as I sit here , there is something in this house that is wanted very anxiously by a number of people . 
The lines are closing up , Miss Innes . 
The paper was the one he had found among Arnold Armstrong's effects , and I read it again by altering the plans for rooms , may be possible . 
The best way , in my opinion , would be to the plan for in one of the rooms chimney . 
I think I understand , I said slowly . 
Some one is searching for the secret room , and the invaders And the holes in the plaster Have been in the progress of his Or her investigations . 
On two occasions I think he succeeded . 
On three , at least , I corrected . 
And then I told him about the night before . 
I have been thinking hard , I concluded , and I do not believe the man at the head of the circular staircase was Doctor Walker . 
I don't think he could have got in , and the voice was not his . 
Mr. Jamieson got up and paced the floor , his hands behind him . 
There is something else that puzzles me , he said , stepping before me . 
Mr. Jamieson , did you ever think that Paul Armstrong might not have died a natural death ? That is the thing we are going to try to find out , he replied . 
And then Gertrude came in , announcing a man below to see Mr. Jamieson . 
I want you present at this interview , Miss Innes , he said . 
May Riggs come up ? He has left Doctor Walker and he has something he wants to tell us . 
Riggs came into the room diffidently , but Mr. Jamieson put him at his ease . 
He kept a careful eye on me , however , and slid into a chair by the door when he was asked to sit down . 
Now , Riggs , began Mr. Jamieson kindly . 
You are to say what you have to say before this lady . 
You promised you'd keep it quiet , Mr. Jamieson . 
Riggs plainly did not trust me . 
There was nothing friendly in the glance he turned on me . 
But , first of all , did you bring what you promised ? Riggs produced a roll of papers from under his coat , and handed them over . 
Mr. Jamieson examined them with lively satisfaction , and passed them to me . 
The blue prints of Sunnyside , he said . 
What did I tell you ? Now , Riggs , we are ready . 
I'd never have come to you , Mr. Jamieson , he began , if it hadn't been for Miss Armstrong . 
When Mr. Innes was spirited away , like , and Miss Louise got sick because of it , I thought things had gone far enough . 
I'd done some things for the doctor before that wouldn't just bear looking into , but I turned a bit squeamish . 
Did you help with that ? I asked , leaning forward . 
I didn't even know of it until the next day , when it came out in the Casanova Weekly Ledger . 
But I know who did it , all right . 
I'd better start at the beginning . 
First thing I knew , I got a letter from him , in the west . 
He seemed to be excited , and he said Miss Armstrong had taken a sudden notion to go home and he sent me some money . 
I was to watch for her , to see if she went to Sunnyside , and wherever she was , not to lose sight of her until he got home . 
I traced her to the lodge , and I guess I scared you on the drive one night , Miss Innes . 
And Rosie ! I ejaculated . 
I only wanted to make sure Miss Louise was there . 
Rosie started to run , and I tried to stop her and tell her some sort of a story to account for my being there . 
And the broken china in the basket ? Well , broken china's death to rubber tires , he said . 
I hadn't any complaint against you people here , and the Dragon Fly was a good car . 
So Rosie's highwayman was explained . 
Well , I telegraphed the doctor where Miss Louise was and I kept an eye on her . 
Just a day or so before they came home with the body , I got another letter , telling me to watch for a woman who had been pitted with smallpox . 
Her name was Carrington , and the doctor made things pretty strong . 
If I found any such woman loafing around , I was not to lose sight of her for a minute until the doctor got back . 
Well , I would have had my hands full , but the other woman didn't show up for a good while , and when she did the doctor was home . 
Riggs , I asked suddenly , did you get into this house a day or two after I took it , at night ? I did not , Miss Innes . 
I have never been in the house before . 
Well , the Carrington woman didn't show up until the night Mr. Halsey disappeared . 
She came to the office late , and the doctor was out . 
She waited around , walking the floor and working herself into a passion . 
When the doctor didn't come back , she was in an awful way . 
She wanted me to hunt him , and when he didn't appear , she called him names said he couldn't fool her . 
There was murder being done , and she would see him swing for it . 
She struck me as being an ugly customer , and when she left , about eleven o'clock , and went across to the Armstrong place , I was not far behind her . 
She walked all around the house first , looking up at the windows . 
Then she rang the bell , and the minute the door was opened she was through it , and into the hall . 
How long did she stay ? That's the queer part of it , Riggs said eagerly . 
She didn't come out that night at all . 
She'd been struck by the express and you would hardly have known her dead , of course . 
I think she stayed all night in the Armstrong house , and the agent said she was crossing the track to take the up train to town when the express struck her . 
Another circle ! I exclaimed . 
Then we are just where we started . 
Not so bad as that , Miss Innes , Riggs said eagerly . 
Nina Carrington came from the town in California where Mr. Armstrong died . 
Why was the doctor so afraid of her ? The Carrington woman knew something . 
I lived with Doctor Walker seven years , and I know him well . 
There are few things he is afraid of . 
I think he killed Mr. Armstrong out in the west somewhere , that's what I think . 
What was it Warner overheard the woman say to Mr. Innes , in the library ? the detective asked me . 
She said I knew there was something wrong from the start . 
A man isn't well one day and dead the next without some reason . 
How perfectly it all seemed to fit ! CHAPTER XXX WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN It was on Wednesday Riggs told us the story of his connection with some incidents that had been previously unexplained . 
Halsey had been gone since the Friday night before , and with the passage of each day I felt that his chances were lessening . 
I knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car , locked in , perhaps , without water or food . 
I had read of cases where bodies had been found locked in cars on isolated sidings in the west , and my spirits went down with every hour . 
His recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance , and was due directly to the tramp Alex had brought to Sunnyside . 
The man knew the detective , and he gave him a piece of dirty paper , on which was scrawled the words He's at City Hospital , Johnsville . 
Again the long distance telephone came into requisition . 
Mr. Jamieson called the hospital , while we crowded around him . 
And when there was no longer any doubt that it was Halsey , and that he would probably recover , we all laughed and cried together . 
I am sure I kissed Liddy , and I have had terrible moments since when I seem to remember kissing Mr. Jamieson , too , in the excitement . 
Anyhow , by eleven o'clock that night Gertrude was on her way to Johnsville , three hundred and eighty miles away , accompanied by Rosie . 
The domestic force was now down to Mary Anne and Liddy , with the under gardener's wife coming every day to help out . 
Fortunately , Warner and the detectives were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge . 
Out of deference to Liddy they washed their dishes once a day , and they concocted queer messes , according to their several abilities . 
They had one triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast , and that clung to their clothes and their hair the rest of the day . 
It was bacon , hardtack and onions , fried together . 
They were almost pathetically grateful , however , I noticed , for an occasional broiled tenderloin . 
Miss Innes , he said , stopping me as I was about to go to my room up stairs , how are your nerves tonight ? I have none , I said happily . 
With Halsey found , my troubles have gone . 
I mean , he persisted , do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual ? The most unusual thing I can think of would be a peaceful night . 
But if anything is going to occur , don't dare to let me miss it . 
Something is going to occur , he said . 
And you're the only woman I can think of that I can take along . 
He looked at his watch . 
Don't ask me any questions , Miss Innes . 
Put on heavy shoes , and some old dark clothes , and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything . 
Liddy was sleeping the sleep of the just when I went up stairs , and I hunted out my things cautiously . 
The detective was waiting in the hall , and I was astonished to see Doctor Stewart with him . 
They were talking confidentially together , but when I came down they ceased . 
I felt that they were doing me honor in making me one of the party , and I would show them I could be as silent as they . 
We went across the fields , passing through the woods that reached almost to the ruins of the stable , going over stiles now and then , and sometimes stepping over low fences . 
Once only somebody spoke , and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from Doctor Stewart when he ran into a wire fence . 
We were joined at the end of five minutes by another man , who fell into step with the doctor silently . 
He carried something over his shoulder which I could not make out . 
In this way we walked for perhaps twenty minutes . 
I had lost all sense of direction I merely stumbled along in silence , allowing Mr. Jamieson to guide me this way or that as the path demanded . 
I hardly know what I expected . 
I walked along with the water sloshing in my boots , and I was actually cheerful . 
I confess that just at that minute even Sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot . 
We had paused at the edge of a level cleared place , bordered all around with primly trimmed evergreen trees . 
Between them I caught a glimpse of starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional more imposing monument , or towering shaft . 
In spite of myself , I drew my breath in sharply . 
We were on the edge of the Casanova churchyard . 
I saw now both the man who had joined the party and the implements he carried . 
It was Alex , armed with two long handled spades . 
After the first shock of surprise , I flatter myself I was both cool and quiet . 
Once , indeed but Mr. Jamieson said it was an owl , and I tried to believe him . 
In the shadow of the Armstrong granite shaft we stopped . 
I think the doctor wanted to send me back . 
It's no place for a woman , I heard him protesting angrily . 
But the detective said something about witnesses , and the doctor only came over and felt my pulse . 
There is an air of finality about a grave one watches the earth thrown in , with the feeling that this is the end . 
Whatever has gone before , whatever is to come in eternity , that particular temple of the soul has been given back to the elements from which it came . 
Thus , there is a sense of desecration , of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of things , in resurrecting a body from its mother clay . 
The doctor kept a keen lookout , but no one appeared . 
Once in a while he came over to me , and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder . 
I never expected to come to this , he said once . 
There's one thing sure I'll not be suspected of complicity . 
A doctor is generally supposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging them up . 
The uncanny moment came when Alex and Jamieson tossed the spades on the grass , and I confess I hid my face . 
There was a period of stress , I think , while the heavy coffin was being raised . 
And then I heard a low exclamation from the detective and I felt the pressure of the doctor's fingers on my arm . 
Now , Miss Innes , he said gently . 
If you will come over I held on to him frantically , and somehow I got there and looked down . 
The lid of the casket had been raised and a silver plate on it proved we had made no mistake . 
But the face that showed in the light of the lantern was a face I had never seen before . 
I went asleep as soon as I reached this decision , and in my dreams I lived over again the events of the night . 
Only , in my dreams , he said it over and over until he seemed to shriek it in my ears . 
I wakened early , in spite of my fatigue , and lay there thinking . 
Who was Alex ? I no longer believed that he was a gardener . 
Who was the man whose body we had resurrected ? And where was Paul Armstrong ? Probably living safely in some extraditionless country on the fortune he had stolen . 
In some way the woman had learned of the substitution , and had tried to use her knowledge for blackmail . 
Halsey had been half crazed by what he heard it was evident that Louise was marrying Doctor Walker to keep the shameful secret , for her mother's sake . 
Halsey , always reckless , had gone at once to Doctor Walker and denounced him . 
There had been a scene , and he left on his way to the station to meet and notify Mr. Jamieson of what he had learned . 
The doctor was active mentally and physically . 
The rest of the story we knew . 
That was my reconstructed theory of that afternoon and evening it was almost correct not quite . 
There was a telegram that morning from Gertrude . 
Probably home in day or so . 
With Halsey found and improving in health , and with at last something to work on , I began that day , Thursday , with fresh courage . 
As Mr. Jamieson had said , the lines were closing up . 
That I was to be caught and almost finished in the closing was happily unknown to us all . 
It was late when I got up . 
I lay in my bed , looking around the four walls of the room , and trying to imagine behind what one of them a secret chamber might lie . 
Certainly , in daylight , Sunnyside deserved its name never was a house more cheery and open , less sinister in general appearance . 
The slip had said chimney . 
It was the only clue , and a house as large as Sunnyside was full of them . 
The trunk room , just over my head , had an open fireplace and a brick chimney , and yet , there was nothing of the kind in my room . 
I got out of bed and examined the opposite wall closely . 
There was apparently no flue , and I knew there was none in the hall just beneath . 
The house was heated by steam , as I have said before . 
In the living room was a huge open fireplace , but it was on the other side . 
The hole in the trunk room wall still yawned there , between the chimney and the outer wall . 
I examined it again , with no new result . 
The space between the brick wall and the plaster and lath one , however , had a new significance . 
The hole showed only one side of the chimney , and I determined to investigate what lay in the space on the other side of the mantel . 
I had no tools , but after rummaging around I found a pair of garden scissors and a hatchet , and thus armed , I set to work . 
The plaster came out easily the lathing was more obstinate . 
It gave under the blows , only to spring back into place again , and the necessity for caution made it doubly hard . 
I had a blister on my palm when at last the hatchet went through and fell with what sounded like the report of a gun to my overstrained nerves . 
I sat on a trunk , waiting to hear Liddy fly up the stairs , with the household behind her , like the tail of a comet . 
But nothing happened , and with a growing feeling of uncanniness I set to work enlarging the opening . 
The result was absolutely nil . 
It was in no sense of the word a secret chamber , and it was evident it had not been disturbed since the house was built . 
It was a supreme disappointment . 
It had been Mr. Jamieson's idea that the hidden room , if there was one , would be found somewhere near the circular staircase . 
In fact , I knew that he had once investigated the entire length of the clothes chute , hanging to a rope , with this in view . 
I was reluctantly about to concede that he had been right , when my eyes fell on the mantel and fireplace . 
I hurried into the next room . 
Yes , sure enough , there was a similar mantel and fireplace there , similarly closed . 
In both rooms the chimney flue extended well out from the wall . 
I measured with the tape line , my hands trembling so that I could scarcely hold it . 
They extended two feet and a half into each room , which , with the three feet of space between the two partitions , made eight feet to be accounted for . 
Eight feet in one direction and almost seven in the other what a chimney it was ! But I had only located the hidden room . 
That there was a means of entrance , and probably a simple one , I could be certain . 
In support of her story she carried in my wet and muddy boots , that I had unluckily forgotten to hide , and held them out to the detective and myself . 
What did I tell you ? she said dramatically . 
They're yours , Miss Rachel and covered with mud and soaked to the tops . 
I tell you , you can scoff all you like something has been wearing your shoes . 
As sure as you sit there , there's the smell of the graveyard on them . 
How do we know they weren't tramping through the Casanova churchyard last night , and sitting on the graves ! Mr. Jamieson almost choked to death . 
I wouldn't be at all surprised if they were doing that very thing , Liddy , he said , when he got his breath . 
They certainly look like it . 
I think the detective had a plan , on which he was working , and which was meant to be a coup . 
But things went so fast there was no time to carry it into effect . 
The first thing that occurred was a message from the Charity Hospital that Mrs. Watson was dying , and had asked for me . 
I did not care much about going . 
There is a sort of melancholy pleasure to be had out of a funeral , with its pomp and ceremony , but I shrank from a death bed . 
However , Liddy got out the black things and the crape veil I keep for such occasions , and I went . 
I left Mr. Jamieson and the day detective going over every inch of the circular staircase , pounding , probing and measuring . 
I was inwardly elated to think of the surprise I was going to give them that night as it turned out , I DID surprise them almost into spasms . 
I drove from the train to the Charity Hospital , and was at once taken to a ward . 
There , in a gray walled room in a high iron bed , lay Mrs. Watson . 
She was very weak , and she only opened her eyes and looked at me when I sat down beside her . 
We had been so engrossed that I had left this poor creature to die without even a word of sympathy . 
The nurse gave her a stimulant , and in a little while she was able to talk . 
So broken and half coherent , however , was her story that I shall tell it in my own way . 
Briefly , then , the housekeeper's story was this She was almost forty years old , and had been the sister mother of a large family of children . 
One by one they had died , and been buried beside their parents in a little town in the Middle West . 
There was only one sister left , the baby , Lucy . 
On her the older girl had lavished all the love of an impulsive and emotional nature . 
When Anne , the elder , was thirty two and Lucy was nineteen , a young man had come to the town . 
The sisters , of course , knew nothing of this , and the young man's ardor rather carried them away . 
In a word , seven years before , Lucy Haswell had married a young man whose name was given as Aubrey Wallace . 
Anne Haswell had married a carpenter in her native town , and was a widow . 
For three months everything went fairly well . 
Aubrey took his bride to Chicago , where they lived at a hotel . 
Perhaps the very unsophistication that had charmed him in Valley Mill jarred on him in the city . 
He had been far from a model husband , even for the three months , and when he disappeared Anne was almost thankful . 
It was different with the young wife , however . 
She drooped and fretted , and on the birth of her baby boy , she had died . 
Anne took the child , and named him Lucien . 
Anne had had no children of her own , and on Lucien she had lavished all her aborted maternal instinct . 
On one thing she was determined , however that was that Aubrey Wallace should educate his boy . 
It was a part of her devotion to the child that she should be ambitious for him he must have every opportunity . 
And so she came east . 
She drifted around , doing plain sewing and keeping a home somewhere always for the boy . 
Finally , however , she realized that her only training had been domestic , and she put the boy in an Episcopalian home , and secured the position of housekeeper to the Armstrongs . 
There she found Lucien's father , this time under his own name . 
I gathered that there was no particular enmity at that time in Anne's mind . 
She told him of the boy , and threatened exposure if he did not provide for him . 
Indeed , for a time , he did so . 
Then he realized that Lucien was the ruling passion in this lonely woman's life . 
He found out where the child was hidden , and threatened to take him away . 
Where Arnold had given money for Lucien's support , as the years went on he forced money from Anne Watson instead until she was always penniless . 
The lower Arnold sank in the scale , the heavier his demands became . 
With the rupture between him and his family , things were worse . 
Anne took the child from the home and hid him in a farmhouse near Casanova , on the Claysburg road . 
There she went sometimes to see the boy , and there he had taken fever . 
The people were Germans , and he called the farmer's wife Grossmutter . 
He had grown into a beautiful boy , and he was all Anne had to live for . 
The Armstrongs left for California , and Arnold's persecutions began anew . 
He was furious over the child's disappearance and she was afraid he would do her some hurt . 
She left the big house and went down to the lodge . 
When I had rented Sunnyside , however , she had thought the persecutions would stop . 
She had applied for the position of housekeeper , and secured it . 
That had been on Saturday . 
That night Louise arrived unexpectedly . 
Thomas sent for Mrs. Watson and then went for Arnold Armstrong at the Greenwood Club . 
Anne had been fond of Louise she reminded her of Lucy . 
She did not know what the trouble was , but Louise had been in a state of terrible excitement . 
Mrs. Watson tried to hide from Arnold , but he was ugly . 
He left the lodge and went up to the house about two thirty , was admitted at the east entrance and came out again very soon . 
Something had occurred , she didn't know what but very soon Mr. Innes and another gentleman left , using the car . 
Thomas and she had got Louise quiet , and a little before three , Mrs. Watson started up to the house . 
Thomas had a key to the east entry , and gave it to her . 
On the way across the lawn she was confronted by Arnold , who for some reason was determined to get into the house . 
He had a golf stick in his hand , that he had picked up somewhere , and on her refusal he had struck her with it . 
One hand had been badly cut , and it was that , poisoning having set in , which was killing her . 
She broke away in a frenzy of rage and fear , and got into the house while Gertrude and Jack Bailey were at the front door . 
She went up stairs , hardly knowing what she was doing . 
Gertrude's door was open , and Halsey's revolver lay there on the bed . 
She picked it up and turning , ran part way down the circular staircase . 
She could hear Arnold fumbling at the lock outside . 
She slipped down quietly and opened the door he was inside before she had got back to the stairs . 
It was quite dark , but she could see his white shirt bosom . 
From the fourth step she fired . 
As he fell , somebody in the billiard room screamed and ran . 
When the alarm was raised , she had had no time to get up stairs she hid in the west wing until every one was down on the lower floor . 
Then she slipped upstairs , and threw the revolver out of an upper window , going down again in time to admit the men from the Greenwood Club . 
If Thomas had suspected , he had never told . 
When she found the hand Arnold had injured was growing worse , she gave the address of Lucien at Richfield to the old man , and almost a hundred dollars . 
The money was for Lucien's board until she recovered . 
She had sent for me to ask me if I would try to interest the Armstrongs in the child . 
When she found herself growing worse , she had written to Mrs. Armstrong , telling her nothing but that Arnold's legitimate child was at Richfield , and imploring her to recognize him . 
She was dying the boy was an Armstrong , and entitled to his father's share of the estate . 
The papers were in her trunk at Sunnyside , with letters from the dead man that would prove what she said . 
She was going she would not be judged by earthly laws and somewhere else perhaps Lucy would plead for her . 
It was she who had crept down the circular staircase , drawn by a magnet , that night Mr. Jamieson had heard some one there . 
Pursued , she had fled madly , anywhere through the first door she came to . 
She had fallen down the clothes chute , and been saved by the basket beneath . 
I could have cried with relief then it had not been Gertrude , after all ! That was the story . 
Sad and tragic though it was , the very telling of it seemed to relieve the dying woman . 
She did not know that Thomas was dead , and I did not tell her . 
I promised to look after little Lucien , and sat with her until the intervals of consciousness grew shorter and finally ceased altogether . 
So Jamieson was putting the screws on lightly now , but ready to give them a twist or two , I felt certain , very soon . 
Mr. Jamieson , having failed to locate the secret room , had gone to the village . 
I learned afterwards that he called at Doctor Walker's , under pretense of an attack of acute indigestion , and before he left , had inquired about the evening trains to the city . 
Well , give a place a reputation like that , and you don't need a guard at all , thus Jamieson . 
And sure enough , late in the afternoon , the two private detectives , accompanied by Mr. Jamieson , walked down the main street of Casanova and took a city bound train . 
That they got off at the next station and walked back again to Sunnyside at dusk , was not known at the time . 
Personally , I knew nothing of either move I had other things to absorb me at that time . 
Liddy brought me some tea while I rested after my trip , and on the tray was a small book from the Casanova library . 
It was called The Unseen World and had a cheerful cover on which a half dozen sheeted figures linked hands around a headstone . 
At this point in my story , Halsey always says Trust a woman to add two and two together , and make six . 
To which I retort that if two and two plus X make six , then to discover the unknown quantity is the simplest thing in the world . 
That a houseful of detectives missed it entirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two make four . 
The depression due to my visit to the hospital left me at the prospect of seeing Halsey again that night . 
It was about five o'clock when Liddy left me for a nap before dinner , having put me into a gray silk dressing gown and a pair of slippers . 
I listened to her retreating footsteps , and as soon as she was safely below stairs , I went up to the trunk room . 
The place had not been disturbed , and I proceeded at once to try to discover the entrance to the hidden room . 
The openings on either side , as I have said , showed nothing but perhaps three feet of brick wall . 
There was no sign of an entrance no levers , no hinges , to give a hint . 
Either the mantel or the roof , I decided , and after a half hour at the mantel , productive of absolutely no result , I decided to try the roof . 
I am not fond of a height . 
The few occasions on which I have climbed a step ladder have always left me dizzy and weak in the knees . 
The top of the Washington monument is as impossible to me as the elevation of the presidential chair . 
And yet I climbed out on to the Sunnyside roof without a second's hesitation . 
The twelve feet looked short from below , but they were difficult to climb . 
I gathered my silk gown around me , and succeeded finally in making the top of the ladder . 
Once there , however , I was completely out of breath . 
I sat down , my feet on the top rung , and put my hair pins in more securely , while the wind bellowed my dressing gown out like a sail . 
I had torn a great strip of the silk loose , and now I ruthlessly finished the destruction of my gown by jerking it free and tying it around my head . 
From far below the smallest sounds came up with peculiar distinctness . 
I could hear the paper boy whistling down the drive , and I heard something else . 
I heard the thud of a stone , and a spit , followed by a long and startled meiou from Beulah . 
I forgot my fear of a height , and advanced boldly almost to the edge of the roof . 
It was half past six by that time , and growing dusk . 
You boy , down there ! I called . 
The paper boy turned and looked around . 
Then , seeing nobody , he raised his eyes . 
Once he fell , and his impetus was so great that he turned an involuntary somersault . 
He was up and off again without any perceptible pause , and he leaped the hedge which I am sure under ordinary stress would have been a feat for a man . 
I am glad in this way to settle the Gray Lady story , which is still a choice morsel in Casanova . 
I believe the moral deduced by the village was that it is always unlucky to throw a stone at a black cat . 
With Johnny Sweeny a cloud of dust down the road , and the dinner hour approaching , I hurried on with my investigations . 
Luckily , the roof was flat , and I was able to go over every inch of it . 
I picked up a pebble from the roof and dropped it down , listening with my ear at one of the pipes . 
I could hear it strike on something with a sharp , metallic sound , but it was impossible for me to tell how far it had gone . 
I gave up finally and went down the ladder again , getting in through the ball room window without being observed . 
Made of wood and carved , the more I looked the more I wondered that I had not noticed before the absurdity of such a mantel in such a place . 
It was covered with scrolls and panels , and finally , by the merest accident , I pushed one of the panels to the side . 
It moved easily , revealing a small brass knob . 
It is not necessary to detail the fluctuations of hope and despair , and not a little fear of what lay beyond , with which I twisted and turned the knob . 
It moved , but nothing seemed to happen , and then I discovered the trouble . 
I pushed the knob vigorously to one side , and the whole mantel swung loose from the wall almost a foot , revealing a cavernous space beyond . 
I had time to get a hazy view of a small portable safe , a common wooden table and a chair then the mantel door swung to , and clicked behind me . 
I stood quite still for a moment , in the darkness , unable to comprehend what had happened . 
Then I turned and beat furiously at the door with my fists . 
It was closed and locked again , and my fingers in the darkness slid over a smooth wooden surface without a sign of a knob . 
I was furiously angry at myself , at the mantel door , at everything . 
I did not fear suffocation before the thought had come to me I had already seen a gleam of light from the two small ventilating pipes in the roof . 
They supplied air , but nothing else . 
The room itself was shrouded in blackness . 
I sat down in the stiff backed chair and tried to remember how many days one could live without food and water . 
I must have dozed off . 
I am sure I did not faint . 
I was never more composed in my life . 
I remember planning , if I were not discovered , who would have my things . 
I knew Liddy would want my heliotrope poplin , and she's a fright in lavender . 
Once or twice I heard mice in the partitions , and so I sat on the table , with my feet on the chair . 
I imagined I could hear the search going on through the house , and once some one came into the trunk room I could distinctly hear footsteps . 
In the chimney ! In the chimney ! I called with all my might , and was rewarded by a piercing shriek from Liddy and the slam of the trunk room door . 
I felt easier after that , although the room was oppressively hot and enervating . 
I had no doubt the search for me would now come in the right direction , and after a little , I dropped into a doze . 
How long I slept I do not know . 
It must have been several hours , for I had been tired from a busy day , and I wakened stiff from my awkward position . 
I could not remember where I was for a few minutes , and my head felt heavy and congested . 
Gradually I roused to my surroundings , and to the fact that in spite of the ventilators , the air was bad and growing worse . 
I was breathing long , gasping respirations , and my face was damp and clammy . 
I must have been there a long time , and the searchers were probably hunting outside the house , dredging the creek , or beating the woodland . 
I knew that another hour or two would find me unconscious , and with my inability to cry out would go my only chance of rescue . 
It was the combination of bad air and heat , probably , for some inadequate ventilation was coming through the pipes . 
The house was very still . 
Once my straining ears seemed to catch a footfall beneath me , possibly in my own room . 
I groped for the chair from the table , and pounded with it frantically on the floor . 
But nothing happened I realized bitterly that if the sound was heard at all , no doubt it was classed with the other rappings that had so alarmed us recently . 
It was impossible to judge the flight of time . 
I measured five minutes by counting my pulse , allowing seventy two beats to the minute . 
But it took eternities , and toward the last I found it hard to count my head was confused . 
And then I heard sounds from below me , in the house . 
There was a peculiar throbbing , vibrating noise that I felt rather than heard , much like the pulsing beat of fire engines in the city . 
For one awful moment I thought the house was on fire , and every drop of blood in my body gathered around my heart then I knew . 
It was the engine of the automobile , and Halsey had come back . 
Halsey's clear head and Gertrude's intuition might do what Liddy's hysteria and three detectives had failed in . 
After a time I thought I had been right . 
There was certainly something going on down below doors were slamming , people were hurrying through the halls , and certain high notes of excited voices penetrated to me shrilly . 
The first warning I had was a stealthy fumbling at the lock of the mantel door . 
With my mouth open to scream , I stopped . 
Perhaps the situation had rendered me acute , perhaps it was instinctive . 
Whatever it was , I sat without moving , and some one outside , in absolute stillness , ran his fingers over the carving of the mantel and found the panel . 
Watch the end staircases ! Jamieson was shouting . 
Damnation there's no light here ! And then a second later . 
One two three The door into the trunk room had been locked from the inside . 
Only and Liddy always screams and puts her fingers in her ears at this point only now I was not alone in the chimney room . 
There was some one else in the darkness , some one who breathed hard , and who was so close I could have touched him with my hand . 
I was in a paralysis of terror . 
Outside there were excited voices and incredulous oaths . 
The trunks were being jerked around in a frantic search , the windows were thrown open , only to show a sheer drop of forty feet . 
And the man in the room with me leaned against the mantel door and listened . 
His pursuers were plainly baffled I heard him draw a long breath , and turn to grope his way through the blackness . 
Then he touched my hand , cold , clammy , death like . 
A hand in an empty room ! He drew in his breath , the sharp intaking of horror that fills lungs suddenly collapsed . 
Beyond jerking his hand away instantly , he made no movement . 
I think absolute terror had him by the throat . 
Then he stepped back , without turning , retreating foot by foot from The Dread in the corner , and I do not think he breathed . 
Then , with the relief of space between us , I screamed , ear splittingly , madly , and they heard me outside . 
In the chimney ! I shrieked . 
Behind the mantel ! The mantel ! With an oath the figure hurled itself across the room at me , and I screamed again . 
In his blind fury he had missed me I heard him strike the wall . 
That one time I eluded him I was across the room , and I had got the chair . 
He stood for a second , listening , then he made another rush , and I struck out with my weapon . 
I think it stunned him , for I had a second's respite when I could hear him breathing , and some one shouted outside We Can't get in . 
How does it open ? But the man in the room had changed his tactics . 
I knew he was creeping on me , inch by inch , and I could not tell from where . 
And then he caught me . 
He held his hand over my mouth , and I bit him . 
I was helpless , strangling , and some one was trying to break in the mantel from outside . 
It began to yield somewhere , for a thin wedge of yellowish light was reflected on the opposite wall . 
When he saw that , my assailant dropped me with a curse then the opposite wall swung open noiselessly , closed again without a sound , and I was alone . 
In the next room ! I called wildly . 
The next room ! But the sound of blows on the mantel drowned my voice . 
By the time I had made them understand , a couple of minutes had elapsed . 
The pursuit was taken up then , by all except Alex , who was determined to liberate me . 
When I stepped out into the trunk room , a free woman again , I could hear the chase far below . 
I must say , for all Alex's anxiety to set me free , he paid little enough attention to my plight . 
He jumped through the opening into the secret room , and picked up the portable safe . 
I am going to put this in Mr. Halsey's room , Miss Innes , he said , and I shall send one of the detectives to guard it . 
And the air ! The touch of the cool night air on my face ! As Alex and I reached the second floor , Mr. Jamieson met us . 
He was grave and quiet , and he nodded comprehendingly when he saw the safe . 
Will you come with me for a moment , Miss Innes ? he asked soberly , and on my assenting , he led the way to the east wing . 
There were lights moving around below , and some of the maids were standing gaping down . 
They screamed when they saw me , and drew back to let me pass . 
There was a sort of hush over the scene Alex , behind me , muttered something I could not hear , and brushed past me without ceremony . 
Then I realized that a man was lying doubled up at the foot of the staircase , and that Alex was stooping over him . 
As I came slowly down , Winters stepped back , and Alex straightened himself , looking at me across the body with impenetrable eyes . 
In his hand he held a shaggy gray wig , and before me on the floor lay the man whose headstone stood in Casanova churchyard Paul Armstrong . 
Winters told the story in a dozen words . 
He had died as Winters reached him . 
As the detective finished , I saw Halsey , pale and shaken , in the card room doorway , and for the first time that night I lost my self control . 
I put my arms around my boy , and for a moment he had to support me . 
Twice I opened my mouth then I turned Halsey around and pointed . 
They were quite unconscious of us her head was on his shoulder , his face against her hair . 
As it happened , it was Mr. Jamieson who broke up the tableau . 
He stepped over to Alex and touched him on the arm . 
Of my share in discovering the secret chamber they have been singularly silent . 
The inner history has never been told . 
What Halsey said to Mrs. Armstrong I never knew , but that he was considerate and chivalrous I feel confident . 
It was Halsey's way always with women . 
He and Louise had no conversation together until that night . 
At half after nine , growing weary of my own company , I went down stairs to find the young people . 
At the door of the living room I paused . 
Gertrude and Jack had returned and were there , sitting together on a divan , with only one lamp lighted . 
They did not see or hear me , and I beat a hasty retreat to the library . 
But here again I was driven back . 
Louise was sitting in a deep chair , looking the happiest I had ever seen her , with Halsey on the arm of the chair , holding her close . 
It was no place for an elderly spinster . 
I retired to my up stairs sitting room and got out Eliza Klinefelter's lavender slippers . 
Ah , well , the foster motherhood would soon have to be put away in camphor again . 
The next day , by degrees , I got the whole story . 
Paul Armstrong had a besetting evil the love of money . 
Common enough , but he loved money , not for what it would buy , but for its own sake . 
The railroad in New Mexico had apparently drained the banker's private fortune , and he determined to retrieve it by one stroke . 
This was nothing less than the looting of the bank's securities , turning them into money , and making his escape . 
But the law has long arms . 
Paul Armstrong evidently studied the situation carefully . 
Just as the only good Indian is a dead Indian , so the only safe defaulter is a dead defaulter . 
He decided to die , to all appearances , and when the hue and cry subsided , he would be able to enjoy his money almost anywhere he wished . 
The first necessity was an accomplice . 
The connivance of Doctor Walker was suggested by his love for Louise . 
The man was unscrupulous , and with the girl as a bait , Paul Armstrong soon had him fast . 
What was simpler ? The woman , Nina Carrington , was the cog that slipped . 
What she only suspected , what she really knew , we never learned . 
She was a chambermaid in the hotel at C , and it was evidently her intention to blackmail Doctor Walker . 
His position at that time was uncomfortable to pay the woman to keep quiet would be confession . 
He denied the whole thing , and she went to Halsey . 
It was this that had taken Halsey to the doctor the night he disappeared . 
He accused the doctor of the deception , and , crossing the lawn , had said something cruel to Louise . 
Then , furious at her apparent connivance , he had started for the station . 
Doctor Walker and Paul Armstrong the latter still lame where I had shot him hurried across to the embankment , certain only of one thing . 
Halsey must not tell the detective what he suspected until the money had been removed from the chimney room . 
They stepped into the road in front of the car to stop it , and fate played into their hands . 
The car struck the train , and they had only to dispose of the unconscious figure in the road . 
This they did as I have told . 
To go back to Paul Armstrong . 
At the last moment his plans had been frustrated . 
Sunnyside , with its hoard in the chimney room , had been rented without his knowledge ! Attempts to dislodge me having failed , he was driven to breaking into his own house . 
Louise and her mother had , from the first , been the great stumbling blocks . 
The plan had been to send Louise away until it was too late for her to interfere , but she came back to the hotel at C just at the wrong time . 
There was a terrible scene . 
Fanny Armstrong was a weakling , but Louise was more difficult to manage . 
She had no love for her stepfather , but her devotion to her mother was entire , self sacrificing . 
Forced into acquiescence by her mother's appeals , overwhelmed by the situation , the girl consented and fled . 
From somewhere in Colorado she sent an anonymous telegram to Jack Bailey at the Traders' Bank . 
Trapped as she was , she did not want to see an innocent man arrested . 
The telegram , received on Thursday , had sent the cashier to the bank that night in a frenzy . 
Louise arrived at Sunnyside and found the house rented . 
Not knowing what to do , she sent for Arnold at the Greenwood Club , and told him a little , not all . 
She told him that there was something wrong , and that the bank was about to close . 
That his father was responsible . 
Of the conspiracy she said nothing . 
To her surprise , Arnold already knew , through Bailey that night , that things were not right . 
Moreover , he suspected what Louise did not , that the money was hidden at Sunnyside . 
He had a scrap of paper that indicated a concealed room somewhere . 
His inherited cupidity was aroused . 
It was in response to one Bailey had sent , and it said that Paul Armstrong was very ill . 
He decided to go west and find Paul Armstrong , and to force him to disgorge . 
But the catastrophe at the bank occurred sooner than he had expected . 
John Bailey had known Paul Armstrong intimately . 
He did not believe that the money was gone in fact , it was hardly possible in the interval since the securities had been taken . 
Where was it ? And from some chance remark let fall some months earlier by Arnold Armstrong at a dinner , Bailey felt sure there was a hidden room at Sunnyside . 
He tried to see the architect of the building , but , like the contractor , if he knew of the such a room he refused any information . 
It was Halsey's idea that John Bailey come to the house as a gardener , and pursue his investigations as he could . 
His smooth upper lip had been sufficient disguise , with his change of clothes , and a hair cut by a country barber . 
So it was Alex , Jack Bailey , who had been our ghost . 
Gertrude , I learned , had watched all night beside me , in an extremity of anxiety about me . 
That old Thomas had seen his master , and thought he had seen the Sunnyside ghost , there could be no doubt . 
On the night before Arnold Armstrong was murdered , Jack Bailey had made his first attempt to search for the secret room . 
He secured Arnold's keys from his room at the club and got into the house , armed with a golf stick for sounding the walls . 
He ran against the hamper at the head of the stairs , caught his cuff link in it , and dropped the golf stick with a crash . 
He was glad enough to get away without an alarm being raised , and he took the owl train to town . 
The oddest thing to me was that Mr. Jamieson had known for some time that Alex was Jack Bailey . 
BAILEY ? Well , it is all over now . 
Paul Armstrong rests in Casanova churchyard , and this time there is no mistake . 
Sunnyside is for sale no , I shall not buy it . 
Little Lucien Armstrong is living with his step grandmother , and she is recovering gradually from troubles that had extended over the entire period of her second marriage . 
Anne Watson lies not far from the man she killed , and who as surely caused her death . 
Thomas , the fourth victim of the conspiracy , is buried on the hill . 
With Nina Carrington , five lives were sacrificed in the course of this grim conspiracy . 
There will be two weddings before long , and Liddy has asked for my heliotrope poplin to wear to the church . 
She has wanted it for three years , and she was quite ugly the time I spilled coffee on it . 
We are very quiet , just the two of us . 
Liddy still clings to her ghost theory , and points to my wet and muddy boots in the trunk room as proof . 
I am gray , I admit , but I haven't felt as well in a dozen years . 
Sometimes , when I am bored , I ring for Liddy , and we talk things over . 
When Warner married Rosie , Liddy sniffed and said what I took for faithfulness in Rosie had been nothing but mawkishness . 
I have not yet outlived Liddy's contempt because I gave them silver knives and forks as a wedding gift . 
So we sit and talk , and sometimes Liddy threatens to leave , and often I discharge her , but we stay together somehow . 
I am talking of renting a house next year , and Liddy says to be sure there is no ghost . 
To be perfectly frank , I never really lived until that summer . 
Time has passed since I began this story . 
My neighbors are packing up for another summer . 
Liddy is having the awnings put up , and the window boxes filled . 
Liddy or no Liddy , I shall advertise to morrow for a house in the country , and I don't care if it has a Circular Staircase .
